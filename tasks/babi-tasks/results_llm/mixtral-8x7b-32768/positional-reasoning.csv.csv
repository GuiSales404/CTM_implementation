The red square is to the right of the triangle. The pink rectangle is below the red square. Is the triangle to the left of the pink rectangle?,yes,"No.

The red square is to the right of the triangle, and the pink rectangle is below the red square. However, this does not give us enough information to determine if the triangle is to the left or right of the pink rectangle. If the red square is far enough to the right of the triangle, then it is possible for the triangle to be to the left of the pink rectangle. But if the red square is directly below the triangle, then the triangle and the pink rectangle would be on the same horizontal line, so the triangle could not be to the left of the pink rectangle. Since the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact positions of the shapes, we cannot definitively say whether the triangle is to the left of the pink rectangle."
Is the triangle to the right of the pink rectangle?,no,"No, we cannot definitively say whether the triangle is to the right of the pink rectangle, based on the information provided. It is possible for the triangle to be to the left, to the right, or on the same horizontal line as the pink rectangle. The red square is to the right of the triangle, and the pink rectangle is below the red square. However, we do not know the exact positions of the shapes, so we cannot make a definitive statement about their relative positions."
