Daniel went to the bathroom. Sandra travelled to the garden. Is Sandra in the bedroom?,no,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Sandra is in the bedroom based on the information given. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says Daniel went to the bathroom. That means Daniel's current location is the bathroom. Now, Sandra traveled to the garden, so Sandra is in the garden. The question is asking if Sandra is in the bedroom.

I need to determine if Sandra being in the garden means she can't be in the bedroom. From what I know, a person can't be in two places at once unless specified otherwise. Since Sandra went to the garden, she's there, not in the bedroom.

Wait, is there any possibility that Sandra could have moved from the garden to the bedroom after going there? The problem doesn't mention that. It only states that Sandra traveled to the garden. So, based on the given information, she's in the garden.

Therefore, Sandra isn't in the bedroom. The answer should be no.
