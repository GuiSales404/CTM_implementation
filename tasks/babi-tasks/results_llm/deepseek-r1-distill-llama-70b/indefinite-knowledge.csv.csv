Mary is in the office. Mary is in the school. Is Mary in the school?,yes,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether Mary is in the school based on the given statements. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says, ""Mary is in the office. Mary is in the school. Is Mary in the school?"" Hmm, that seems a bit confusing at first glance. Let me parse each sentence carefully.

The first statement is ""Mary is in the office."" So, that means Mary is present in the office. The second statement is ""Mary is in the school."" So, according to this, Mary is also present in the school. Now, the question is asking, ""Is Mary in the school?"" So, I need to determine if both statements can be true at the same time or if there's a contradiction.

Wait a minute, can Mary be in two places at once? Normally, a person can't be in two different locations simultaneously unless the office is part of the school. Maybe the office is located within the school building. For example, Mary could be working in the school's office, which is inside the school. That would mean she is both in the office and in the school at the same time. So, in that case, both statements would be true.

Alternatively, if the office and the school are separate buildings, then Mary can't be in both places at the same time. But the problem doesn't specify that the office is a separate location. It just says she's in the office and in the school. So, it's possible that the office is part of the school.

Therefore, considering that the office could be within the school, both statements can be true. So, the answer would be yes, Mary is in the school.

I think that's the most straightforward way to interpret it. Unless there's a trick where the statements are meant to contradict each other, but I don't see any indication of that. The problem seems to be testing logical consistency and the possibility of overlapping locations.
