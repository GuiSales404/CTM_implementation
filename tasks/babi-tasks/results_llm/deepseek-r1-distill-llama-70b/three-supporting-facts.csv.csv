John went to the bathroom. John took the milk. Daniel journeyed to the garden. John discarded the milk. John picked up the milk. Sandra travelled to the hallway. Sandra grabbed the football. John travelled to the bedroom. Sandra put down the football there. Sandra went to the garden. John travelled to the office. John dropped the milk there. Where was the milk before the office?,bedroom,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out where the milk was before John took it to the office. Let me read through the problem again and break it down step by step.

First, the events happen in order, so I should list them out as they occur. Let me see:

1. John went to the bathroom.
2. John took the milk.
3. Daniel journeyed to the garden.
4. John discarded the milk.
5. John picked up the milk.
6. Sandra travelled to the hallway.
7. Sandra grabbed the football.
8. John travelled to the bedroom.
9. Sandra put down the football there.
10. Sandra went to the garden.
11. John travelled to the office.
12. John dropped the milk there.

Wait, but the question is asking where the milk was before the office. So I need to trace the milk's location from when John took it until he dropped it in the office.

Let me focus on John's actions with the milk:

- John took the milk (step 2). So he has the milk now.
- Then, John discarded the milk (step 4). So he got rid of it somewhere. But where? The location isn't specified yet, but right before that, he was in the bathroom (step 1). So maybe he discarded it in the bathroom?
- But then, John picked up the milk again (step 5). So he must have gone back to where he discarded it to pick it up. So after discarding it, he picks it up again, so he has the milk again.

After that, John travels to the bedroom (step 8). So he goes from wherever he was (probably the bathroom) to the bedroom. Then, after some other events, he travels to the office (step 11) and drops the milk there (step 12).

So before the office, where was the milk? Well, after picking it up again (step 5), he would have had the milk with him. Then he went to the bedroom (step 8), so the milk was in the bedroom with him. Then, when he went to the office, he took the milk there and dropped it.

Wait, but does he have the milk in the bedroom? Let me make sure.

After step 5, John picks up the milk again. So he has it. Then, step 8: John travels to the bedroom. So he takes the milk with him to the bedroom. Then, later, he goes to the office and drops it there.

So before the office, the milk was in the bedroom because that's where John was before going to the office.

Wait, but let me double-check the timeline. After step 5, John has the milk. Then, Sandra does some actions, but those don't affect the milk. Then John goes to the bedroom (step 8). So he takes the milk there. Then, Sandra puts down the football in the bedroom (step 9). Then Sandra goes to the garden (step 10). Then John goes to the office (step 11) and drops the milk there (step 12).

So the milk was in the bedroom before John took it to the office. Therefore, the answer should be the bedroom.
