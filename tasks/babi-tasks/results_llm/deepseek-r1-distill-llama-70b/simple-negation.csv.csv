Daniel travelled to the garden. Sandra is in the bathroom. Is Sandra in the kitchen?,no,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out if Sandra is in the kitchen based on the given information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the text says that Daniel went to the garden. That means Daniel is in the garden, but it doesn't say anything about Sandra being there. So, Sandra isn't necessarily in the garden.

Next, it says Sandra is in the bathroom. That's a clear statement. So, Sandra is in the bathroom. Now, the question is asking if Sandra is in the kitchen. 

I guess I should think about whether being in the bathroom and the kitchen at the same time is possible. Usually, a person can only be in one place at a time unless they're moving between rooms, but the text doesn't mention that. It just states Sandra is in the bathroom.

So, if Sandra is in the bathroom, she can't be in the kitchen at the same time. Therefore, the answer should be no, Sandra is not in the kitchen.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The information is straightforward. Daniel is in the garden, Sandra is in the bathroom. No mention of the kitchen, so she's not there.
