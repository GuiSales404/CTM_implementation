John went to the bathroom. Daniel travelled to the garden. Mary moved to the hallway. Sandra moved to the bedroom. Daniel journeyed to the hallway. Mary picked up the apple there. What is Mary carrying?,apple,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out what Mary is carrying based on the information given. Let me go through each sentence one by one to make sure I understand the sequence of events.

First, John went to the bathroom. That doesn't seem relevant to Mary, so I'll note that but focus on the others. Next, Daniel travelled to the garden. So Daniel is in the garden now. Then, Mary moved to the hallway. So Mary is in the hallway. After that, Sandra moved to the bedroom, so Sandra is in the bedroom. Then Daniel journeyed to the hallway. Wait, so Daniel was in the garden and now he's moving to the hallway. So now Daniel is in the hallway with Mary. 

Then the next sentence says Mary picked up the apple there. The word ""there"" refers to the hallway since that's where Mary is. So Mary picked up an apple in the hallway. The question is, what is Mary carrying? Since she picked up the apple, she must be carrying it. 

I don't see any other objects mentioned that Mary is carrying. The other people moved to different places, but the only action involving an object is Mary picking up the apple. So the answer should be that Mary is carrying the apple.
