John went back to the bedroom. Afterwards he went to the office. Where is John?,office,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out where John is based on the given information. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the problem says, ""John went back to the bedroom. Afterwards he went to the office."" So, the sequence of events is that John went to the bedroom first, and then after that, he went to the office.

I'm trying to visualize this. So, John starts somewhere, goes to the bedroom, and then from the bedroom, he goes to the office. The question is asking where he is now.

Wait, does it matter where he was before going to the bedroom? The problem doesn't specify his starting point, just that he went back to the bedroom. The word ""back"" suggests that he was there before, but maybe that's not important for the current location.

So, the key movements are: Bedroom → Office. Since he went to the office after the bedroom, that should be his current location unless there's more information. But the problem stops there, so I think the answer is that he's in the office.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. It's a straightforward sequence of events, so the last place he went to is where he is now.

Daniel is in the office."
Mary journeyed to the kitchen. Following that she moved to the office. Where is Daniel?,office,"<think>

Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The question is about determining where Daniel is based on the movements described. 

First, let's parse the information given:

1. ""Daniel went back to the kitchen."" This indicates that Daniel's first movement was to the kitchen.
2. ""Afterwards he went to the office."" This shows that after being in the kitchen, Daniel moved to the office.

Now, the question is asking, ""Where is Daniel?"" Based on the sequence of events, Daniel's last known location is the office. There's no further information suggesting he moved again after that. 

It's also important to note that the question mistakenly refers to Mary in the last sentence, but since the subject of the question is Daniel, we'll focus on his movements.

So, putting it all together, Daniel's current location is the office.

Answer: Daniel is in the office."
