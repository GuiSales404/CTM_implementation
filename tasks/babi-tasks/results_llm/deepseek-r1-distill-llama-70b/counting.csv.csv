Mary picked up the football there. Sandra grabbed the apple there. How many objects is Sandra carrying?,one,"<think>
Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about Mary and Sandra picking up objects, and we need to determine how many objects Sandra is carrying. 

First, I'll read the problem again carefully. It says, ""Mary picked up the football there. Sandra grabbed the apple there. How many objects is Sandra carrying?"" 

So, breaking it down, Mary picked up a football. That means Mary has the football. Then Sandra grabbed an apple. The question is about Sandra, so I need to focus on what Sandra is carrying. 

Wait, the problem doesn't mention Sandra carrying anything else besides the apple. It only says she grabbed the apple. So, does that mean she's only carrying one object? 

I should make sure I'm not missing anything. The problem doesn't state that Sandra had anything before grabbing the apple, so it's safe to assume she only has the apple. Mary's action is just providing context, but it doesn't affect Sandra's count. 

So, Sandra is carrying one object, which is the apple. Therefore, the answer should be 1.
