Okay, let's try to figure out the color of Julius. So, from the problem, we have several animals and their colors. Let me list out the information first to make it clearer.

We have:
- Bernhard is a swan and white.
- Brian is a rhino and white.
- Lily is a swan and white.
- Julius is a frog.
- Greg is a frog and white.

So, the question is asking about Julius's color. Now, I need to see if there's any information that connects Julius's species to a color. 

Looking at the data, both Brian the rhino and Greg the frog are white. Also, both Bernhard and Lily, who are swans, are white. So, it seems like all the mentioned animals except Julius have their colors specified as white. 

Since Julius is a frog and the only other frog mentioned, Greg, is white, it might be a pattern that all frogs here are white. But wait, let me make sure I'm not assuming something that's not stated. The problem doesn't explicitly say that all frogs are white, but since Greg is a frog and white, and there's no conflicting information about Julius, it's logical to conclude that Julius is also white.

I don't see any information suggesting that Julius is a different color, so the most straightforward answer is that Julius is white.
