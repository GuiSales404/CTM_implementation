John and Sandra travelled to the garden. Then they moved to the bedroom. Where is John?,bedroom,"<think>
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out where John is based on the information given. Let me break it down step by step. 

First, the text says that John and Sandra went to the garden. So both of them were at the garden together. Then it mentions that they moved to the bedroom. The key word here is ""moved,"" which implies that they both left the garden and went to the bedroom. 

Now, the question is asking where John is. Since both John and Sandra moved from the garden to the bedroom, it logically follows that John is now in the bedroom. There's no indication that John went somewhere else after that. So, putting it all together, John's current location is the bedroom.

John is in the bedroom."
Mary and John travelled to the bathroom. After that they journeyed to the hallway. Where is Mary?,hallway,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out where Mary is based on the information given. Let me start by breaking down the details step by step.

First, the text says that Mary and John went to the bathroom. So both of them were in the bathroom together. Then it mentions that after that, they journeyed to the hallway. The word ""journeyed"" here suggests that they moved from the bathroom to the hallway. 

The question is asking where Mary is. Since both Mary and John moved from the bathroom to the hallway, it stands to reason that Mary is now in the hallway. There's no indication that Mary went anywhere else after that. So, putting it all together, Mary's current location is the hallway.

Mary is in the hallway."
Sandra and Daniel travelled to the office. Following that they went back to the hallway. Where is Sandra?,hallway,"<think>
Alright, let's figure out where Sandra is based on the information given. 

First, Sandra and Daniel went to the office. So both of them were in the office together. Then it says they went back to the hallway. The word ""back"" here suggests that they returned to a place they had been before, which in this context is the hallway.

So, Sandra was in the office and then she moved back to the hallway. There's no mention of her going anywhere else after that. Therefore, Sandra is now in the hallway.

Sandra and John travelled to the bedroom. Afterwards they travelled to the hallway. Where is Daniel?,hallway,"<think>
Okay, so I need to figure out where Daniel is based on the information given. Let me break it down step by step.

First, the text says that Sandra and Daniel went to the office. So both Sandra and Daniel were in the office together. Then it mentions that after that, they went back to the hallway. The phrase ""went back"" suggests that they returned to a place they had been before, which in this context is the hallway.

So, Sandra and Daniel were in the office and then they moved back to the hallway. The question is asking where Daniel is. Since both Sandra and Daniel moved from the office to the hallway, it logically follows that Daniel is now in the hallway. There's no indication that Daniel went somewhere else after that.

Wait, but the question is about Daniel, and the previous messages were about John, Mary, and Sandra. Let me make sure I'm focusing on the correct information.

In the last question, it says Sandra and John travelled to the bedroom, and then they travelled to the hallway. But the question is about Daniel. So, I think I need to refer back to the earlier part where Sandra and Daniel went to the office and then back to the hallway.

So, to clarify, Sandra and Daniel went to the office and then back to the hallway. Therefore, Daniel is in the hallway.

But wait, in the last part, it says Sandra and John went to the bedroom and then to the hallway. So, Sandra is in the hallway, but what about Daniel? Did he go somewhere else?

Hmm, the information about Daniel is only in the part where he and Sandra went to the office and then back to the hallway. There's no mention of Daniel going anywhere else after that. So, based on that, Daniel is in the hallway.

But the question is asking where Daniel is, and the last information about him is that he went back to the hallway. So, the answer should be that Daniel is in the hallway.
