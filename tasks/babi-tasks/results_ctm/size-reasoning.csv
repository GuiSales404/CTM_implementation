Okay, so I've got this problem here: ""Mary is in the office. Mary is in the school. Is Mary in the school?"" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem states two things about Mary's location. It says she's in the office and also in the school. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Mary can't be in two places at the same time, right? Unless she's moving between them, but the way it's phrased sounds like she's in both places simultaneously, which isn't possible. So, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, or it's a trick question.

But let's assume the problem is correct as given. So, if Mary is in the office and also in the school, and the question is asking if she's in the school, then logically, if she's in the school, the answer would be yes. But wait, that doesn't consider the fact that she can't be in two places at once. So, maybe the problem is testing whether I recognize that contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured in a way that the second statement overrides the first. Like, maybe the first statement is old information, and the second is the current situation. So, if Mary was in the office but then went to the school, the answer would be yes. But the way it's written is ""Mary is in the office. Mary is in the school."" So, it's not clear if these are sequential or simultaneous.

Wait, in the problem, it's presented as two separate statements without any indication of time. So, it's possible that both are true at the same time, which is impossible, or that one is a correction of the other. If the second statement is a correction, then Mary is actually in the school, making the answer yes. But if both are meant to be true, then it's a contradiction, and the answer would be no because she can't be in both places.

But in logic problems, usually, each statement is considered true unless stated otherwise. So, if both are true, then Mary is in both the office and the school, which is impossible, so the answer would be no. But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking if she's in the school, and if she's in both, then she is in the school.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If Mary is in the office and also in the school, then regardless of the impossibility, according to the statements, she is in the school. So, the answer should be yes. But that's ignoring the real-world impossibility. In logic, sometimes you have to accept the premises as true, even if they're impossible in reality.

So, the problem is a bit of a paradox, but based on the given statements, Mary is in the school, so the answer is yes. But I'm not entirely sure because it's contradictory. Maybe the answer is yes because the second statement says she's in the school, so that's the current location, overriding the first statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is testing if I can recognize that both can't be true, so the answer is no because she can't be in both. But I'm not sure. I think the intended answer is yes because the second statement places her in the school, so the answer is yes.

The problem presents two conflicting statements about Mary's location. Logically, if both are accepted as true, Mary cannot be in two places at once. However, the second statement places her in the school, so the answer is:
