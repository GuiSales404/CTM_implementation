Okay, so I need to figure out where the milk was before the office based on the given sentences. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's list out the actions involving the milk:

1. John went to the bathroom and took the milk.
2. Then, Daniel went to the garden, but that doesn't involve the milk.
3. John discarded the milk. So, he got rid of it somewhere, maybe in the bathroom or another room.
4. After that, John picked up the milk again. So, he must have gone back to where he left it.
5. Later, John traveled to the bedroom, but I don't think he had the milk then because he had already discarded it.
6. Sandra went to the garden and handled the football, which isn't relevant here.
7. John then traveled to the office and dropped the milk there.

Wait, so after John picked up the milk again, he went to the office and dropped it there. So before going to the office, where was the milk? Let me retrace:

- John took the milk in the bathroom.
- He discarded it, so the milk was in the bathroom until he discarded it.
- Then he picked it up again, so maybe he was in the bathroom again or another room.
- Then he went to the office and dropped it there.

So, the last place before the office where the milk was is the bathroom because that's where he picked it up again after discarding it. Alternatively, maybe he was in another room when he picked it up, but the text doesn't specify. The key point is that before he went to the office, he had the milk, and he dropped it in the office. So the milk was with John before he went to the office, but the question is asking where the milk was before the office. So the location before the office would be the bathroom because that's where he initially took it and then picked it up again after discarding it.

Wait, no, after discarding it, he picked it up again. So the milk was in the bathroom when he discarded it, then he picked it up again from the bathroom, and then took it to the office. So before the office, the milk was in the bathroom.

Alternatively, maybe he moved it from another place. Let me check the sentences again.

The sentence is: ""John went to the bathroom. John took the milk. Daniel journeyed to the garden. John discarded the milk. John picked up the milk. Sandra traveled to the hallway. Sandra grabbed the football. John traveled to the bedroom. Sandra put down the football there. Sandra went to the garden. John traveled to the office. John dropped the milk there.""

So, John took the milk in the bathroom, then discarded it (probably in the bathroom). Then he picked up the milk againâ€”so he must have gone back to where he discarded it, which is the bathroom. Then he traveled to the bedroom, but he had the milk with him. Then he went to the office and dropped it there.

Wait, no. Let me clarify the sequence:

1. John went to the bathroom.
2. Took the milk (so milk is now with him in the bathroom).
3. Daniel went to the garden (unrelated).
4. John discarded the milk (so milk is now in the bathroom).
5. John picked up the milk again (so he must have gone back to the bathroom to get it).
6. Sandra went to the hallway and grabbed the football (unrelated).
7. John traveled to the bedroom (with the milk).
8. Sandra put down the football in the bedroom.
9. Sandra went to the garden.
10. John traveled to the office.
11. John dropped the milk there.

So, the milk was in the bathroom when John discarded it. Then he picked it up again, so it was in the bathroom before he took it to the office. Therefore, before the office, the milk was in the bathroom.

Wait, but after picking it up, he went to the bedroom. So when he was in the bedroom, he had the milk. Then he went to the office and dropped it. So before the office, he was in the bedroom with the milk. So the milk was in the bedroom before the office.

Hmm, I'm getting confused. Let me map it step by step:

- John in bathroom: takes milk.
- John discards milk in bathroom.
- John picks up milk again (from bathroom).
- John goes to bedroom with milk.
- Then John goes to office and drops milk.

So, the milk was in the bedroom before he went to the office. Therefore, the milk was in the bedroom before the office.

Wait, but when he picked up the milk again, he was in the bathroom, then he went to the bedroom. So the milk was in the bathroom when he picked it up, then moved to the bedroom, and then to the office.

So, the last location before the office was the bedroom. Therefore, the milk was in the bedroom before the office.

But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.

After John discards the milk in the bathroom, he picks it up again. So he's back in the bathroom, takes the milk, then goes to the bedroom. So the milk is with him in the bedroom. Then he goes to the office and drops it there. So before the office, the milk was in the bedroom.

Yes, that makes sense. So the answer should be the bedroom.

The milk was in the bedroom before John took it to the office.

Okay, so I've got this problem here: ""Mary picked up the football there. Sandra grabbed the apple there. How many objects is Sandra carrying?"" I need to figure out how many objects Sandra is carrying based on the given sentences.

First, let me break down the information. The first sentence says Mary picked up the football. That means Mary has the football. The second sentence says Sandra grabbed the apple. So Sandra has the apple. The question is asking about Sandra, not Mary.

So, focusing on Sandra, she grabbed the apple. There's no mention of her picking up anything else. Mary is carrying the football, but that's separate from Sandra. Therefore, Sandra is carrying one object, which is the apple.

I don't think there's any trick here. It's straightforward. Each action is about a different person, and each person is carrying one object. So Sandra has one object.

Okay, so I need to figure out where Bill was before he went to the cinema. Let me read the sentence again: ""Bill journeyed to the cinema this morning. Bill moved to the office yesterday. Where was Bill before the cinema?"" 

Hmm, so the question is about Bill's location before he went to the cinema. The first part says he went to the cinema this morning. The second part mentions he moved to the office yesterday. 

Wait, so yesterday he was at the office, and this morning he went to the cinema. So before going to the cinema this morning, where was he? Well, if he moved to the office yesterday, that means he was at the office before going to the cinema this morning. 

I think the key here is understanding the timeline. Yesterday, he was at the office, and then this morning, he went to the cinema. So the place he was before the cinema would be the office. 

I don't see any other locations mentioned, so it must be the office. Yeah, that makes sense. So the answer should be the office.
