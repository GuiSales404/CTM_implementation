Okay, so I've got this problem here: ""Mary is in the office. Mary is in the school. Is Mary in the school?"" Hmm, that's a bit confusing. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem states two things about Mary's location. It says she's in the office and also in the school. Wait, that doesn't make sense because Mary can't be in two places at the same time, right? Unless she's moving between them, but the way it's phrased sounds like she's in both places simultaneously, which isn't possible. So, maybe there's a mistake in the problem, or it's a trick question.

But let's assume the problem is correct as given. So, if Mary is in the office and also in the school, and the question is asking if she's in the school, then logically, if she's in the school, the answer would be yes. But wait, that doesn't consider the fact that she can't be in two places at once. So, maybe the problem is testing whether I recognize that contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is structured in a way that the second statement overrides the first. Like, maybe the first statement is old information, and the second is the current situation. So, if Mary was in the office but then went to the school, the answer would be yes. But the way it's written is ""Mary is in the office. Mary is in the school."" So, it's not clear if these are sequential or simultaneous.

Wait, in the problem, it's presented as two separate statements without any indication of time. So, it's possible that both are true at the same time, which is impossible, or that one is a correction of the other. If the second statement is a correction, then Mary is actually in the school, making the answer yes. But if both are meant to be true, then it's a contradiction, and the answer would be no because she can't be in both places.

But in logic problems, usually, each statement is considered true unless stated otherwise. So, if both are true, then Mary is in both the office and the school, which is impossible, so the answer would be no. But that doesn't make sense because the question is asking if she's in the school, and if she's in both, then she is in the school.

Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If Mary is in the office and also in the school, then regardless of the impossibility, according to the statements, she is in the school. So, the answer should be yes. But that's ignoring the real-world impossibility. In logic, sometimes you have to accept the premises as true, even if they're impossible in reality.

So, the problem is a bit of a paradox, but based on the given statements, Mary is in the school, so the answer is yes. But I'm not entirely sure because it's contradictory. Maybe the answer is yes because the second statement says she's in the school, so that's the current location, overriding the first statement.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is testing if I can recognize that both can't be true, so the answer is no because she can't be in both. But I'm not sure. I think the intended answer is yes because the second statement places her in the school, so the answer is yes.

The problem presents two conflicting statements about Mary's location. Logically, if both are accepted as true, Mary cannot be in two places at once. However, the second statement places her in the school, so the answer is:

Okay, so I've got this problem here, and I need to figure out where John is. Let me read it again carefully. The sentence says, ""Daniel travelled to the kitchen. John journeyed to the kitchen. Where is John?"" Hmm, that seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I don't miss anything.

First, let's break it down. The first part is about Daniel moving to the kitchen. Then, John also goes to the kitchen. The question is asking where John is. So, at first glance, it looks like both Daniel and John went to the same place, the kitchen. So, logically, John should be in the kitchen.

Wait, but sometimes in these problems, there might be a trick or a play on words. Let me think if there's any reason why John wouldn't be in the kitchen. Maybe there's something about the way they moved? Daniel travelled, and John journeyed. Are those words implying something different? I don't think so. Both ""travelled"" and ""journeyed"" mean moving from one place to another, so they both ended up in the kitchen.

Is there any other information that could change this? The sentence doesn't mention anyone else moving or any other locations. It's just Daniel and John both going to the kitchen. So, unless there's a hidden detail, John is in the kitchen.

I guess the answer is that John is in the kitchen. I don't see any reason to doubt that based on the information given.

Okay, let's try to figure out what Mary is carrying. So, the sentence is: ""John went to the bathroom. Daniel travelled to the garden. Mary moved to the hallway. Sandra moved to the bedroom. Daniel journeyed to the hallway. Mary picked up the apple there. What is Mary carrying?""

First, I'll break down each part. John went to the bathroom, but that doesn't seem relevant to what Mary is carrying. Then Daniel went to the garden, Mary to the hallway, Sandra to the bedroom. Then Daniel went to the hallway again, and there Mary picked up an apple.

So, the key part is ""Mary picked up the apple there."" The ""there"" refers to the hallway since that's where Mary and Daniel were. So, Mary picked up an apple in the hallway. Therefore, Mary is carrying an apple.

I don't think the other movements affect what Mary is carrying because the question specifically asks about Mary after she picked up the apple. So, the answer should be that Mary is carrying an apple.

Okay, so I have this problem here: ""John went back to the bedroom. Afterwards he went to the office. Where is John?"" I need to figure out where John is based on the information given.

Let me break it down step by step. First, John went back to the bedroom. So, he was somewhere else before, and then he returned to the bedroom. Then, it says ""afterwards he went to the office."" The word ""afterwards"" suggests that after going to the bedroom, his next action was going to the office.

So, the sequence of events is: somewhere else → bedroom → office. The question is asking where John is now. Since the last action mentioned is him going to the office, that should be his current location.

I don't see any indication that he left the office after that. So, logically, John should be in the office now.

I think that's it. It's a straightforward sequence of movements, and the last place he went to is the office. So, the answer should be the office.
