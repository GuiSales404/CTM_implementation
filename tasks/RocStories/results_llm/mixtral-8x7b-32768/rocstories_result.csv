"Marcy wondered about the kids. She had been in the kitchen and hadn't heard them in awhile. Usually, when the kids were quiet, they were getting into something. Marcy looked in the bedrooms and didn't see them.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. She found them in the living room reading and was relieved. 
2. The children were in the kitchen eating lunch.","Marcy wondered about the kids. She had been in the kitchen and hadn't heard them in awhile. Usually, when the kids were quiet, they were getting into something. Marcy looked in the bedrooms and didn't see them.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. She found them in the living room reading and was relieved. 
2. The children were in the kitchen eating lunch.",1,"1. She found them in the living room reading and was relieved.

The first fragment, ""She found them in the living room reading and was relieved,"" concludes the story in a coherent way. This ending aligns with the logical flow, thematic consistency, and causal coherence of the preceding story. Marcy was initially worried because the kids were quiet, which usually meant they were getting into something. When she searched for them and didn't find them in the bedrooms, she became more concerned. However, finding them quietly reading in the living room provides a sense of relief and resolution to the story.

The second fragment, ""The children were in the kitchen eating lunch,"" does not provide a coherent conclusion. Although it addresses Marcy's concern about the kids being quiet, it does not explain why she didn't find them in the bedrooms or the kitchen. This ending creates confusion and does not align with the logical flow and causal coherence established in the story."
"Juan wanted to be a luchador. He grew up watching them on television. He practiced every day in the basement. Eventually he got added to small shows.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Juan decided that being  luchador was a stupid aspiration. 
2. Juan was very successful eventually.","Juan wanted to be a luchador. He grew up watching them on television. He practiced every day in the basement. Eventually he got added to small shows.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Juan decided that being  luchador was a stupid aspiration. 
2. Juan was very successful eventually.",2,"2. Juan was very successful eventually.

This ending aligns better with the logical flow, thematic consistency, and causal coherence of the story. Juan's consistent practice and dedication to becoming a luchador indicate a strong passion and commitment to the aspiration. It is more likely that he would achieve success rather than deciding it was a stupid aspiration after putting in so much effort."
"A man ordered pancakes in a diner from the server. She brought him a plate of pancakes minutes later. The man complained that the pancakes were too thick. The server brought them back to the cook.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The cook praised him. 
2. The cook decided to remake the pancakes.","A man ordered pancakes in a diner from the server. She brought him a plate of pancakes minutes later. The man complained that the pancakes were too thick. The server brought them back to the cook.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The cook praised him. 
2. The cook decided to remake the pancakes.",2,"2. The cook decided to remake the pancakes.

This ending is more coherent with the preceding story because it addresses the man's complaint about the thickness of the pancakes. The cook remaking the pancakes shows that they are taking the customer's feedback into account, aiming for satisfaction. On the other hand, the first option about the cook praising him doesn't seem related to the issue at hand and thus, it doesn't provide a coherent conclusion to the story."
"Gina was using a restroom at a gas station. She went to wash her hands, but there was no soap. She looked in the cabinet under the sink hoping to find some. There was no soap there either.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Gina stole al the soap that was in the bathroom. 
2. So she had to settle for rinsing her hands off.","Gina was using a restroom at a gas station. She went to wash her hands, but there was no soap. She looked in the cabinet under the sink hoping to find some. There was no soap there either.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Gina stole al the soap that was in the bathroom. 
2. So she had to settle for rinsing her hands off.",2,"2. So she had to settle for rinsing her hands off.

Explanation:

The first option, ""Gina stole all the soap that was in the bathroom,"" is not a coherent conclusion to the story. There is no indication in the story that Gina was unable to find soap because it was stolen or that she would consider stealing soap. This option is not consistent with Gina's character or the situation presented in the story.

The second option, ""So she had to settle for rinsing her hands off,"" is a coherent conclusion to the story. It follows logically from the situation presented in the story, where Gina is unable to find any soap to wash her hands. This option aligns with the causal coherence and thematic consistency of the story."
"Sam's parents were out for the weekend. He decided to host a party. Many people came. The partiers ended up trashing the house.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Sam's parents were upset they had missed the fun. 
2. Sam was in real trouble.","Sam's parents were out for the weekend. He decided to host a party. Many people came. The partiers ended up trashing the house.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Sam's parents were upset they had missed the fun. 
2. Sam was in real trouble.",2,"2. Sam was in real trouble.

The first option contradicts the information provided in the story fragments, as it suggests that Sam's parents were not upset about the house being trashed. However, the second option aligns with the logical flow, thematic consistency, and causal coherence of the story, as it is a natural consequence of Sam's actions and his parents' likely reaction."
"Gina whispered to Mary in detention. The girls giggled together. Gina could tell the teacher wasn't pleased. They continued to whisper.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The teacher told them to stop talking. 
2. The teacher joined their conversation.","Gina whispered to Mary in detention. The girls giggled together. Gina could tell the teacher wasn't pleased. They continued to whisper.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The teacher told them to stop talking. 
2. The teacher joined their conversation.",1,"1. The teacher told them to stop talking. 

The second option does not align with the story because it represents a break in the established narrative. Throughout the story, Gina and Mary are whispering and giggling despite the teacher's displeasure. The teacher telling them to stop talking is a logical consequence of their behavior and maintains the established power dynamic between the students and the teacher. The teacher joining their conversation would be unexpected and would shift the narrative in a new direction that is not suggested by the provided fragments."
"Bob's stomach was really bothering him after the big meal. A friend he had dined with called to say she was feeling ill, too. They decided the seafood they'd eaten had been bad. Sometime later, Bob finally threw up the contents of his stomach.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Bob will be careful that he never eats at that restaurant again. 
2. Bob's decision to embezzle from his employer was a mistake.","Bob's stomach was really bothering him after the big meal. A friend he had dined with called to say she was feeling ill, too. They decided the seafood they'd eaten had been bad. Sometime later, Bob finally threw up the contents of his stomach.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Bob will be careful that he never eats at that restaurant again. 
2. Bob's decision to embezzle from his employer was a mistake.",1,"1. Bob will be careful that he never eats at that restaurant again.

The second option, ""Bob's decision to embezzle from his employer was a mistake,"" is not related to the story fragments provided. The story revolves around Bob and his friend getting food poisoning from a meal they shared. Therefore, the first option is the correct and coherent ending to the story."
"Abigail keeps a strict schedule. She takes a walk in the morning and at night. She walks for about 30 minutes at a time around the neighborhood. Sometimes she even takes her dog Dexter.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. And so Abigail was able to lose a lot of weight. 
2. Abigail climbed off her wheelchair and onto the bed.","Abigail keeps a strict schedule. She takes a walk in the morning and at night. She walks for about 30 minutes at a time around the neighborhood. Sometimes she even takes her dog Dexter.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. And so Abigail was able to lose a lot of weight. 
2. Abigail climbed off her wheelchair and onto the bed.",1,"Based on the provided story fragments, the second option does not seem to be a coherent conclusion. The fragments provided describe Abigail as a person who takes walks around the neighborhood, sometimes with her dog. There is no mention of any physical impairment that would require the use of a wheelchair. Therefore, option 2, which describes Abigail climbing off a wheelchair, is not a coherent ending.

Option 1, on the other hand, provides a logical conclusion to the story. The fragments mention that Abigail keeps a strict schedule and walks around the neighborhood, which could be part of a weight loss routine. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that Abigail was able to lose a lot of weight as a result of her regular walks.

Thus, the correct ending is option 1."
"Ryan was at a park. And he saw a little girl holding a balloon. As he was leaving the park, he saw the same balloon stuck in a tree. He climbed the tree to retrieve the balloon.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Ryan then popped the balloon on purpose. 
2. Ryan then found the girl and gave her the balloon she lost.","Ryan was at a park. And he saw a little girl holding a balloon. As he was leaving the park, he saw the same balloon stuck in a tree. He climbed the tree to retrieve the balloon.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Ryan then popped the balloon on purpose. 
2. Ryan then found the girl and gave her the balloon she lost.",2,"The correct ending is option 2: ""Ryan then found the girl and gave her the balloon she lost."" This conclusion aligns with the logical flow, thematic consistency, and causal coherence of the preceding story. Ryan's actions demonstrate kindness and consideration towards the little girl, which is consistent with the story's focus on his empathy and helpfulness. Popping the balloon (option 1) would not provide a coherent or satisfying ending, as it does not relate to the context of the story and would not explain Ryan's motivation for climbing the tree in the first place."
"Jess hated egg salad. When her friend's mother served it, she knew she had to eat it. Just as she was about to take a bite the family dog walked by. No one was looking so she lowered it towards the dog.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The dog happily ate the salad. 
2. Jess decided to make egg salad.","Jess hated egg salad. When her friend's mother served it, she knew she had to eat it. Just as she was about to take a bite the family dog walked by. No one was looking so she lowered it towards the dog.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The dog happily ate the salad. 
2. Jess decided to make egg salad.",1,"1. The dog happily ate the salad. 

This ending is more coherent with the story because it follows Jess's initial action of trying to feed the dog the egg salad. If the story ended with Jess deciding to make egg salad, it would introduce a new action that is unrelated to the preceding story and would not make logical sense."
"Doug's wife was upset with him. As a way to ask forgiveness he decided to buy her a new car battery. He changed it out and made sure her car was working properly. She appreciated the gesture.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Doug's wife kissed him. 
2. Doug's wife was angry.","Doug's wife was upset with him. As a way to ask forgiveness he decided to buy her a new car battery. He changed it out and made sure her car was working properly. She appreciated the gesture.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Doug's wife kissed him. 
2. Doug's wife was angry.",1,"1. Doug's wife kissed him. This ending is more coherent with the preceding story. Doug's wife was initially upset, but after her husband bought her a new car battery and fixed her car, she appreciated the gesture. This act of kindness and consideration would likely lead to a positive reaction from her, such as kissing him, indicating that she has forgiven him.

2. Doug's wife was angry. This ending is not coherent with the story. Doug's wife was initially angry, but after her husband fixed her car, she appreciated the gesture. There is no indication in the story that she would return to being angry after this act of kindness."
"Last week my girlfriend and I bought three lottery tickets. It's not something we normally do. We were desperate for money. Even a long shot was worth it.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. We decided to go to the zoo. 
2. We were happy to win a small amount of money from the tickets.","Last week my girlfriend and I bought three lottery tickets. It's not something we normally do. We were desperate for money. Even a long shot was worth it.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. We decided to go to the zoo. 
2. We were happy to win a small amount of money from the tickets.",2,"2. We were happy to win a small amount of money from the tickets.

The first fragment, ""We decided to go to the zoo,"" does not logically or thematically follow from the preceding story. The story has been focused on the characters' financial troubles and their purchasing of lottery tickets as a last resort. The zoo does not relate to this central theme and offers no resolution or development of the story's main conflict.

On the other hand, the second fragment, ""We were happy to win a small amount of money from the tickets,"" provides a coherent and satisfying conclusion to the story. It directly addresses the financial struggles and the purchase of the lottery tickets, providing a resolution to the central conflict. Winning some money, even if it is only a small amount, offers a sense of relief and hope for the characters, aligning with the themes of the story."
"Joe was helping his dad clear the woods in the back of their yard. All of a sudden he heard loud buzzing. He had stirred up a bee's nest. He got stung six times before he could escape.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Joe laughed about the experience. 
2. Joe was angry he got hurt.","Joe was helping his dad clear the woods in the back of their yard. All of a sudden he heard loud buzzing. He had stirred up a bee's nest. He got stung six times before he could escape.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Joe laughed about the experience. 
2. Joe was angry he got hurt.",2,"1. Joe laughed about the experience.

The second option, ""Joe was angry he got hurt,"" does not seem to be a coherent conclusion to the story. While it is reasonable that Joe might feel upset or angry about getting stung by bees, the story as presented does not provide any indication that this is the case. On the other hand, the first option, ""Joe laughed about the experience,"" is a more fitting conclusion. It suggests that, despite the pain and discomfort of getting stung, Joe was able to see the humor in the situation and maintain a positive attitude. This is consistent with the tone of the story and does not introduce any new or unexpected elements."
"Lonnie was trying to figure out what majors to take in college. He knew that his end goal was to be a teacher. He asked the career counselor for advice. The counselor gave him a list of prerequisites.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Lonnie finally decided to go into education. 
2. Lonnie threw the list away.","Lonnie was trying to figure out what majors to take in college. He knew that his end goal was to be a teacher. He asked the career counselor for advice. The counselor gave him a list of prerequisites.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Lonnie finally decided to go into education. 
2. Lonnie threw the list away.",1,"1. Lonnie finally decided to go into education.

This ending is the most coherent and aligns with the logical flow, thematic consistency, and causal coherence of the preceding story. Lonnie's goal is to become a teacher, and the career counselor provides him with a list of prerequisites. Lonnie making a decision to go into education after receiving the list of prerequisites is a natural and logical conclusion.

On the other hand, the second ending, where Lonnie throws the list away, does not align with the story's logical flow and thematic consistency. It does not provide a clear resolution or connection to Lonnie's end goal of becoming a teacher."
"A man named Pete got off of work. After work, he drove to the gym. He went into the gym and found a workout machine. While working out, Pete worked up a sweat.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. He showered after he finished working out. 
2. Pete went to the baseball stadium.","A man named Pete got off of work. After work, he drove to the gym. He went into the gym and found a workout machine. While working out, Pete worked up a sweat.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. He showered after he finished working out. 
2. Pete went to the baseball stadium.",1,"1. He showered after he finished working out.

The first fragment, ""He showered after he finished working out,"" is the more coherent and logical ending to the story. This is because it follows the natural sequence of events that would occur after a workout at the gym: after working out and sweating, a person typically showers to clean up. On the other hand, the second fragment, ""Pete went to the baseball stadium,"" is not a coherent ending because it is unrelated to the previous events in the story. There is no mention of Pete having any plans to go to a baseball stadium, so this fragment feels out of place and does not fit with the logical flow of the story."
"Neil took a flight into Bangkok. He walked around to see the sights. There were so many delicious local foods! And the souvenirs were wonderful, too!
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Neil stayed some extra days in Bangkok because of all the fun. 
2. Neil decided he never wanted to go to Bangkok again.","Neil took a flight into Bangkok. He walked around to see the sights. There were so many delicious local foods! And the souvenirs were wonderful, too!
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Neil stayed some extra days in Bangkok because of all the fun. 
2. Neil decided he never wanted to go to Bangkok again.",1,"1. Neil stayed some extra days in Bangkok because of all the fun.

The first option is the more coherent ending for the story. The fragments presented show Neil enjoying his time in Bangkok, appreciating the local food and souvenirs. Therefore, it's reasonable that he would decide to stay some extra days because he's having so much fun.

The second option, stating that Neil decided he never wanted to go to Bangkok again, contradicts the positive tone and experiences presented in the story fragments. It would not align logically with the preceding story."
"Rick grew up in a troubled household. He never found good support in family, and turned to gangs. It wasn't long before Rick got shot in a robbery. The incident caused him to turn a new leaf.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. He is happy now. 
2. He joined a gang.","Rick grew up in a troubled household. He never found good support in family, and turned to gangs. It wasn't long before Rick got shot in a robbery. The incident caused him to turn a new leaf.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. He is happy now. 
2. He joined a gang.",1,"1. He is happy now.

The second option, ""He joined a gang,"" is not a coherent ending to the story because it contradicts the turning point where Rick decided to change his life after getting shot in a robbery. The first option, ""He is happy now,"" provides a sense of closure and aligns with the theme of personal growth and transformation."
"Jeremy's mother didn't approve of his lifestyle. When he was 21, Jeremy decided to move out. He found an apartment in a nearby state with a new job. After several Years he cleaned up, and finances his own life.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Jeremy had to move back in with his mother. 
2. Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible.","Jeremy's mother didn't approve of his lifestyle. When he was 21, Jeremy decided to move out. He found an apartment in a nearby state with a new job. After several Years he cleaned up, and finances his own life.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Jeremy had to move back in with his mother. 
2. Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible.",2,"2. Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible.

This ending aligns with the logical flow, thematic consistency, and causal coherence of the preceding story. Jeremy moved out of his mother's house, started a new life, cleaned up his act, and became financially independent. Ending the story with Jeremy enjoying his newfound responsibility reinforces the positive changes he underwent since leaving his mother's home.

On the other hand, ending the story with Jeremy moving back in with his mother would contradict the progress he made in becoming more responsible and self-sufficient."
"My dog waited for me by the house front door. We walked to the park for playtime and exercise. The dog and I walked around the block before returning home. When we walked through the front door, she took a big drink of water.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Then she lay down and took a nap. 
2. She was jumping up and down begging for a walk.","My dog waited for me by the house front door. We walked to the park for playtime and exercise. The dog and I walked around the block before returning home. When we walked through the front door, she took a big drink of water.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Then she lay down and took a nap. 
2. She was jumping up and down begging for a walk.",1,"1. Then she lay down and took a nap.

This ending is more coherent with the preceding story because it follows the logical flow and thematic consistency of the story. The dog has been waiting for her owner, walking around the park and the block, and drinking water when they returned home. All these actions indicate that the dog has been active and has expended energy. Therefore, it is fitting and coherent for the dog to lie down and take a nap after all these activities.

On the other hand, option 2 is less coherent because it contradicts the previous actions of the dog. If the dog was jumping up and down begging for a walk, it would imply that she still has energy and wants to continue being active. However, the story has already established that the dog has been active and has just come back from a walk. Therefore, it is unlikely that she would be begging for another walk immediately after returning home."
"Ken met a nice man online, and they decided to go on a date. They met at a nice restaurant and shook hands. Ken and his date ordered food and had small talk. While they ate, Ken decided that he really liked the man.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Ken made an excuse to leave quickly. 
2. Ken asked him for a second date.","Ken met a nice man online, and they decided to go on a date. They met at a nice restaurant and shook hands. Ken and his date ordered food and had small talk. While they ate, Ken decided that he really liked the man.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Ken made an excuse to leave quickly. 
2. Ken asked him for a second date.",2,"2. Ken asked him for a second date.

The first option, ""Ken made an excuse to leave quickly,"" contradicts the earlier statement that Ken decided he really liked the man. If Ken truly liked his date, it would be illogical for him to make an excuse to leave quickly. Therefore, the second option, ""Ken asked him for a second date,"" is the more coherent ending, as it aligns with Ken's positive feelings towards his date and suggests a desire to continue getting to know him better."
"Todd and Ashley were dating. Todd got irritated with Ashley. He gave her the silent treatment. Ashley got upset.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. She was mad because Todd wouldn't stop talking. 
2. She decided not to speak to Todd either.","Todd and Ashley were dating. Todd got irritated with Ashley. He gave her the silent treatment. Ashley got upset.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. She was mad because Todd wouldn't stop talking. 
2. She decided not to speak to Todd either.",2,"2. She decided not to speak to Todd either.

The first option contradicts the previous information given in the story fragments. Ashley was upset because Todd was giving her the silent treatment, so it doesn't make sense for her to be mad because Todd wouldn't stop talking. However, the second option aligns with the thematic consistency and causal coherence of the story. Ashley's response to Todd's silent treatment by deciding not to speak to him either maintains the tension in the narrative and is a logical response to Todd's behavior."
"Shay went to the marine park. There she saw a sign advertising dolphin swims. Shay eagerly handed over her $40 and suited up. Then she jumped in the pool to swim with the dolphins.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Shay had a great time. 
2. Shay really didn't like dolphins.","Shay went to the marine park. There she saw a sign advertising dolphin swims. Shay eagerly handed over her $40 and suited up. Then she jumped in the pool to swim with the dolphins.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Shay had a great time. 
2. Shay really didn't like dolphins.",1,"1. Shay had a great time.

The second option, ""Shay really didn't like dolphins,"" is not a coherent conclusion to the story. The story presents Shay as eagerly participating in the dolphin swim and enjoying the experience. There is no information provided in the story that suggests Shay's feelings towards dolphins change or that she has a negative experience. Therefore, the first option, ""Shay had a great time,"" is the more coherent and logical ending to the story."
"Ray went to a friend's house for a sleepover. He realized that he'd forgotten his toothbrush. He was unable to brush his teeth! Ray tried to use toothpaste on his finger, but it was no use.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Finally, Ray  asked his friend if he had a spare toothbrush. 
2. Ray did a good job brushing his teeth.","Ray went to a friend's house for a sleepover. He realized that he'd forgotten his toothbrush. He was unable to brush his teeth! Ray tried to use toothpaste on his finger, but it was no use.

1. Finally, Ray  asked his friend if he had a spare toothbrush. 
2. Ray did a good job brushing his teeth.",1,"1. Finally, Ray asked his friend if he had a spare toothbrush.

This ending is more coherent with the preceding story because it resolves the problem that was introduced at the beginning of the story. Ray forgot his toothbrush and was unable to brush his teeth properly. Asking his friend for a spare toothbrush is a logical solution to this problem.

On the other hand, the second ending, ""Ray did a good job brushing his teeth,"" is not coherent with the story because it contradicts the information that was previously established. The story clearly states that Ray was unable to brush his teeth properly, so it is not possible for him to have done a good job brushing them."
"One man bet another that he could outstare a duck. A duck was found and stared at. Although the duck was unaware of what was happening, it did not blink. It did, however, wet its eyes with its nictitating membrane.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The man eventually blinked. 
2. The man wanted to lose his bet.","One man bet another that he could outstare a duck. A duck was found and stared at. Although the duck was unaware of what was happening, it did not blink. It did, however, wet its eyes with its nictitating membrane.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The man eventually blinked. 
2. The man wanted to lose his bet.",1,"1. The man eventually blinked.

The first ending is the more coherent conclusion to the story. The man made a bet that he could outstare a duck, and the duck did not blink. The man, however, did blink, which means he lost the bet. This ending aligns with the logical flow and causal coherence of the story since the man's blinking is the direct result of his attempt to outstare the duck.

The second ending, while not entirely illogical, is less coherent because it introduces a new element (the man wanting to lose the bet) that was not previously suggested or implied in the story. Additionally, it does not provide a clear resolution to the man's challenge of outstaring the duck."
"Cindy was at a restaurant. And she ordered hot soup. But the waitress forgot to tell her that the bowl was hot. So when received the bowl from the waitress, she hurt her hands.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Cindy went and ran cold water over her hands. 
2. Cindy continued holding the soup.","Cindy was at a restaurant. And she ordered hot soup. But the waitress forgot to tell her that the bowl was hot. So when received the bowl from the waitress, she hurt her hands.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Cindy went and ran cold water over her hands. 
2. Cindy continued holding the soup.",1,"1. Cindy went and ran cold water over her hands.

This ending is the most coherent with the preceding story. After burning her hands, it is logical that Cindy would take action to soothe the pain, such as running cold water over them. Continuing to hold the hot soup, as described in the second option, does not address the injury and would likely exacerbate the pain."
