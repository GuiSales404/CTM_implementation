"Marcy wondered about the kids. She had been in the kitchen and hadn't heard them in awhile. Usually, when the kids were quiet, they were getting into something. Marcy looked in the bedrooms and didn't see them.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. She found them in the living room reading and was relieved. 
2. The children were in the kitchen eating lunch.","Marcy wondered about the kids. She had been in the kitchen and hadn't heard them in awhile. Usually, when the kids were quiet, they were getting into something. Marcy looked in the bedrooms and didn't see them.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. She found them in the living room reading and was relieved. 
2. The children were in the kitchen eating lunch.",1,"The correct answer is 1. She found them in the living room reading and was relieved.

This ending is coherent because it resolves the mystery of the kids' whereabouts, and their quietness is explained by their being engaged in a peaceful activity (reading). It also aligns with the initial concern and relief expressed by Marcy. The alternative ending (2) does not provide a satisfying conclusion, as it simply states where the kids are without addressing the initial concern about their quietness."
"Juan wanted to be a luchador. He grew up watching them on television. He practiced every day in the basement. Eventually he got added to small shows.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Juan decided that being  luchador was a stupid aspiration. 
2. Juan was very successful eventually.","Juan wanted to be a luchador. He grew up watching them on television. He practiced every day in the basement. Eventually he got added to small shows.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Juan decided that being  luchador was a stupid aspiration. 
2. Juan was very successful eventually.",2,"The correct ending is 2. Juan was very successful eventually.

This ending concludes the story in a coherent way because it follows the progression of Juan's journey from wanting to be a luchador to achieving his goal. The previous fragments show Juan's dedication and hard work, and the success he achieves is a natural consequence of those efforts."
"A man ordered pancakes in a diner from the server. She brought him a plate of pancakes minutes later. The man complained that the pancakes were too thick. The server brought them back to the cook.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The cook praised him. 
2. The cook decided to remake the pancakes.","A man ordered pancakes in a diner from the server. She brought him a plate of pancakes minutes later. The man complained that the pancakes were too thick. The server brought them back to the cook.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The cook praised him. 
2. The cook decided to remake the pancakes.",2,"The correct answer is:

2. The cook decided to remake the pancakes.

This ending is more coherent and logical because it continues the sequence of events started by the man's complaint. The cook, upon receiving the feedback, takes action to address the issue by remaking the pancakes. This ending also maintains the theme of customer service and the diner's willingness to improve the customer's experience."
"Gina was using a restroom at a gas station. She went to wash her hands, but there was no soap. She looked in the cabinet under the sink hoping to find some. There was no soap there either.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Gina stole al the soap that was in the bathroom. 
2. So she had to settle for rinsing her hands off.","Gina was using a restroom at a gas station. She went to wash her hands, but there was no soap. She looked in the cabinet under the sink hoping to find some. There was no soap there either.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Gina stole al the soap that was in the bathroom. 
2. So she had to settle for rinsing her hands off.",2,"The correct ending is:

2. So she had to settle for rinsing her hands off.

This ending is coherent because it follows logically from the situation described in the story. Gina is unable to find soap, so she has to settle for rinsing her hands off as an alternative. This ending is also consistent with the theme of inconvenience and frustration that is established in the story."
"Sam's parents were out for the weekend. He decided to host a party. Many people came. The partiers ended up trashing the house.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Sam's parents were upset they had missed the fun. 
2. Sam was in real trouble.","Sam's parents were out for the weekend. He decided to host a party. Many people came. The partiers ended up trashing the house.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Sam's parents were upset they had missed the fun. 
2. Sam was in real trouble.",2,"The correct answer is 2. Sam was in real trouble.

The story fragments describe a party that gets out of hand, causing chaos and destruction. It is logical to conclude that Sam's parents would be upset, but the most coherent and causally consistent ending would be Sam facing the consequences of his actions, which is reflected in option 2."
"Gina whispered to Mary in detention. The girls giggled together. Gina could tell the teacher wasn't pleased. They continued to whisper.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The teacher told them to stop talking. 
2. The teacher joined their conversation.","Gina whispered to Mary in detention. The girls giggled together. Gina could tell the teacher wasn't pleased. They continued to whisper.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The teacher told them to stop talking. 
2. The teacher joined their conversation.",1,"The correct ending is:

1. The teacher told them to stop talking.

This ending is more coherent because it maintains the established tone and dynamic between Gina, Mary, and the teacher. The initial fragments portray the girls as mischievous and the teacher as disapproving, so it's logical that the teacher would reprimand them for continuing to whisper. This ending also maintains the tension and conflict established in the story, whereas the alternative ending (the teacher joining their conversation) would be a sudden and unexplained shift in the narrative."
"Bob's stomach was really bothering him after the big meal. A friend he had dined with called to say she was feeling ill, too. They decided the seafood they'd eaten had been bad. Sometime later, Bob finally threw up the contents of his stomach.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Bob will be careful that he never eats at that restaurant again. 
2. Bob's decision to embezzle from his employer was a mistake.","Bob's stomach was really bothering him after the big meal. A friend he had dined with called to say she was feeling ill, too. They decided the seafood they'd eaten had been bad. Sometime later, Bob finally threw up the contents of his stomach.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Bob will be careful that he never eats at that restaurant again. 
2. Bob's decision to embezzle from his employer was a mistake.",1,"The correct ending is:

1. Bob will be careful that he never eats at that restaurant again.

This ending concludes the story in a coherent way because it relates back to the initial problem (eating bad seafood) and resolves it by establishing a new habit (being careful not to eat at that restaurant again). The other option, about embezzlement, is completely unrelated to the story and does not provide a logical conclusion."
"Abigail keeps a strict schedule. She takes a walk in the morning and at night. She walks for about 30 minutes at a time around the neighborhood. Sometimes she even takes her dog Dexter.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. And so Abigail was able to lose a lot of weight. 
2. Abigail climbed off her wheelchair and onto the bed.","Abigail keeps a strict schedule. She takes a walk in the morning and at night. She walks for about 30 minutes at a time around the neighborhood. Sometimes she even takes her dog Dexter.

1. And so Abigail was able to lose a lot of weight. 
2. Abigail climbed off her wheelchair and onto the bed.",1,"The correct ending is:

1. And so Abigail was able to lose a lot of weight.

This ending is coherent because it continues the theme of Abigail's daily routine and her possible efforts to improve her health. The addition of losing weight is a natural consequence of her regular walking routine and aligns with the narrative's focus on Abigail's daily habits."
"Ryan was at a park. And he saw a little girl holding a balloon. As he was leaving the park, he saw the same balloon stuck in a tree. He climbed the tree to retrieve the balloon.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Ryan then popped the balloon on purpose. 
2. Ryan then found the girl and gave her the balloon she lost.","Ryan was at a park. And he saw a little girl holding a balloon. As he was leaving the park, he saw the same balloon stuck in a tree. He climbed the tree to retrieve the balloon.

2. Ryan then found the girl and gave her the balloon she lost.",2,The correct answer is 2.
"Jess hated egg salad. When her friend's mother served it, she knew she had to eat it. Just as she was about to take a bite the family dog walked by. No one was looking so she lowered it towards the dog.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The dog happily ate the salad. 
2. Jess decided to make egg salad.","Jess hated egg salad. When her friend's mother served it, she knew she had to eat it. Just as she was about to take a bite the family dog walked by. No one was looking so she lowered it towards the dog.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. The dog happily ate the salad. 
2. Jess decided to make egg salad.",1,"The correct ending is:

1. The dog happily ate the salad.

This ending concludes the story in a coherent way because it follows the logical flow of the story. Jess was trying to get rid of the egg salad by feeding it to the dog, and the dog happily eating the salad is a natural consequence of her actions."
"Doug's wife was upset with him. As a way to ask forgiveness he decided to buy her a new car battery. He changed it out and made sure her car was working properly. She appreciated the gesture.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Doug's wife kissed him. 
2. Doug's wife was angry.","Doug's wife was upset with him. As a way to ask forgiveness he decided to buy her a new car battery. He changed it out and made sure her car was working properly. She appreciated the gesture.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Doug's wife kissed him. 
2. Doug's wife was angry.",1,"The correct answer is 1. Doug's wife kissed him.

The story fragment provides a clear resolution to the conflict between Doug and his wife. Doug's wife was upset with him, but he makes an effort to apologize by buying her a new car battery and fixing her car. This gesture shows that he is willing to make amends and care for her. The kiss at the end suggests that his wife has forgiven him and is happy with his apology. Option 2, ""Doug's wife was angry"", does not conclude the story in a coherent way, as it does not provide a resolution to the conflict."
"Last week my girlfriend and I bought three lottery tickets. It's not something we normally do. We were desperate for money. Even a long shot was worth it.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. We decided to go to the zoo. 
2. We were happy to win a small amount of money from the tickets.","Last week my girlfriend and I bought three lottery tickets. It's not something we normally do. We were desperate for money. Even a long shot was worth it.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. We decided to go to the zoo. 
2. We were happy to win a small amount of money from the tickets.",2,"The correct answer is 2. We were happy to win a small amount of money from the tickets.

This ending is coherent because it resolves the motivation presented in the first fragment, which was the couple's desperation for money. Winning a small amount of money, although not the life-changing jackpot they might have hoped for, would still bring them some relief and happiness. The alternative ending, going to the zoo, is unrelated to the initial motivation and doesn't provide a satisfying conclusion to the story."
"Joe was helping his dad clear the woods in the back of their yard. All of a sudden he heard loud buzzing. He had stirred up a bee's nest. He got stung six times before he could escape.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Joe laughed about the experience. 
2. Joe was angry he got hurt.","Joe was helping his dad clear the woods in the back of their yard. All of a sudden he heard loud buzzing. He had stirred up a bee's nest. He got stung six times before he could escape.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Joe laughed about the experience. 
2. Joe was angry he got hurt.",2,I would choose option 2.
"Lonnie was trying to figure out what majors to take in college. He knew that his end goal was to be a teacher. He asked the career counselor for advice. The counselor gave him a list of prerequisites.

2. Lonnie threw the list away.","Lonnie was trying to figure out what majors to take in college. He knew that his end goal was to be a teacher. He asked the career counselor for advice. The counselor gave him a list of prerequisites.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Lonnie finally decided to go into education. 
2. Lonnie threw the list away.",1,"The correct answer is:

1. Lonnie finally decided to go into education.

This ending concludes the story in a coherent way because it shows Lonnie making a decision based on the advice he received from the career counselor. The story sets up Lonnie's goal of becoming a teacher and his need for guidance, and the ending provides a resolution to that goal. It also logically follows from the previous events in the story, as Lonnie would need to decide on a major that aligns with his career aspirations."
"A man named Pete got off of work. After work, he drove to the gym. He went into the gym and found a workout machine. While working out, Pete worked up a sweat.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. He showered after he finished working out. 
2. Pete went to the baseball stadium.","A man named Pete got off of work. After work, he drove to the gym. He went into the gym and found a workout machine. While working out, Pete worked up a sweat.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. He showered after he finished working out. 
2. Pete went to the baseball stadium.",1,"The correct ending is:

1. He showered after he finished working out.

This ending is coherent because it follows a logical sequence of events. After working out, Pete would likely shower to clean himself off and feel refreshed. It's a natural and expected next step after a workout."
"Neil took a flight into Bangkok. He walked around to see the sights. There were so many delicious local foods! And the souvenirs were wonderful, too!
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Neil stayed some extra days in Bangkok because of all the fun. 
2. Neil decided he never wanted to go to Bangkok again.","Neil took a flight into Bangkok. He walked around to see the sights. There were so many delicious local foods! And the souvenirs were wonderful, too!
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Neil stayed some extra days in Bangkok because of all the fun. 
2. Neil decided he never wanted to go to Bangkok again.",1,"The correct ending is:

1. Neil stayed some extra days in Bangkok because of all the fun.

This ending is coherent because it follows the positive tone and excitement established in the original fragments. Neil's initial experience in Bangkok is described as enjoyable, with him appreciating the local food and souvenirs. Staying extra days suggests that he wants to continue exploring and experiencing more of what Bangkok has to offer, which is a logical and consistent conclusion to the story."
"Rick grew up in a troubled household. He never found good support in family, and turned to gangs. It wasn't long before Rick got shot in a robbery. The incident caused him to turn a new leaf.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. He is happy now. 
2. He joined a gang.","Rick grew up in a troubled household. He never found good support in family, and turned to gangs. It wasn't long before Rick got shot in a robbery. The incident caused him to turn a new leaf.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. He is happy now. 
2. He joined a gang.",1,"The correct ending is: 1. He is happy now.

The story fragment describes Rick's troubled past, his involvement in gangs, and his subsequent change of heart after getting shot. The most coherent conclusion would be that Rick, having had a transformative experience, is now happy and having left his gang life behind. Option 2, ""He joined a gang"", contradicts the narrative's direction and Rick's supposed change of heart, making it an incoherent conclusion."
"Jeremy's mother didn't approve of his lifestyle. When he was 21, Jeremy decided to move out. He found an apartment in a nearby state with a new job. After several Years he cleaned up, and finances his own life.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Jeremy had to move back in with his mother. 
2. Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible.","Jeremy's mother didn't approve of his lifestyle. When he was 21, Jeremy decided to move out. He found an apartment in a nearby state with a new job. After several Years he cleaned up, and finances his own life.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Jeremy had to move back in with his mother. 
2. Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible.",2,"The correct answer is 2. Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible.

The story fragments describe Jeremy's decision to move out and start a new life, which implies that he is taking steps towards independence and self-sufficiency. Option 1, ""Jeremy had to move back in with his mother"", contradicts this progression and suggests a regression to a less independent state, which does not logically follow from the previous events. Option 2, ""Jeremy enjoyed being more responsible"", is a natural conclusion to the story, as it suggests that Jeremy has successfully transitioned to a more responsible lifestyle, which aligns with the themes of independence and self-sufficiency established earlier in the story."
"My dog waited for me by the house front door. We walked to the park for playtime and exercise. The dog and I walked around the block before returning home. When we walked through the front door, she took a big drink of water.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Then she lay down and took a nap. 
2. She was jumping up and down begging for a walk.","My dog waited for me by the house front door. We walked to the park for playtime and exercise. The dog and I walked around the block before returning home. When we walked through the front door, she took a big drink of water.
Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Then she lay down and took a nap. 
2. She was jumping up and down begging for a walk.",1,"The correct ending is:

1. Then she lay down and took a nap.

This ending concludes the story in a coherent way because it follows a natural sequence of events. The dog has just returned from a walk and exercise, and now she is resting and taking a nap, which is a common behavior for dogs after physical activity. The second option, ""She was jumping up and down begging for a walk,"" is out of place and disrupts the logical flow of the story."
"Ken met a nice man online, and they decided to go on a date. They met at a nice restaurant and shook hands. Ken and his date ordered food and had small talk. While they ate, Ken decided that he really liked the man.

Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Ken made an excuse to leave quickly. 
2. Ken asked him for a second date.",2,"The correct answer is 2. Ken asked him for a second date.

This ending is coherent because it follows the logical flow of the story, which is that Ken has decided he really likes the man and wants to spend more time with him. The story is building towards a positive outcome, and asking for a second date is a natural next step."
"Todd and Ashley were dating. Todd got irritated with Ashley. He gave her the silent treatment. Ashley got upset.

Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Shay had a great time. 
2. Shay really didn't like dolphins.",1,"The correct answer is:

1. Shay had a great time.

The story fragment provided sets up the expectation that Shay will have a positive experience swimming with the dolphins, as she ""eagerly handed over her $40"" and jumped into the pool. The ending ""Shay had a great time"" is a logical and coherent conclusion to the story, as it follows the expected outcome of Shay's enthusiastic participation."

Which of these fragments concludes the story in a coherent way? 
1. Cindy went and ran cold water over her hands. 
2. Cindy continued holding the soup.",1,"The correct answer is: 1. Cindy went and ran cold water over her hands.

This ending is coherent because it shows Cindy taking action to alleviate the pain and discomfort caused by her burned hands. It is a logical and realistic response to the situation."
