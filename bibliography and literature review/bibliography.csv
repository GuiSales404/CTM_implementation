,When philosophical nuance matters: safeguarding consciousness research from restrictive assumptions,Marius Usher and Niccolò Negro and H. Jacobson and Naotsugu Tsuchiya,Frontiers in Psychology,2023,Connected Papers,null,14,"In this paper, we revisit the debate surrounding the Unfolding Argument (UA) against causal structure theories of consciousness (as well as the hard-criteria research program it prescribes), using it as a platform for discussing theoretical and methodological issues in consciousness research. Causal structure theories assert that consciousness depends on a particular causal structure of the brain. Our claim is that some of the assumptions fueling the UA are not warranted, and therefore we should reject the methodology for consciousness science that the UA prescribes. First, we briefly survey the most popular philosophical positions in consciousness science, namely physicalism and functionalism. We discuss the relations between these positions and the behaviorist methodology that the UA assumptions express, despite the contrary claim of its proponents. Second, we argue that the same reasoning that the UA applies against causal structure theories can be applied to functionalist approaches, thus proving too much and deeming as unscientific a whole range of (non-causal structure) theories. Since this is overly restrictive and fits poorly with common practice in cognitive neuroscience, we suggest that the reasoning of the UA must be flawed. Third, we assess its philosophical assumptions, which express a restrictive methodology, and conclude that there are reasons to reject them. Finally, we propose a more inclusive methodology for consciousness science, that includes neural, behavioral, and phenomenological evidence (provided by the first-person perspective) without which consciousness science could not even start. Then, we extend this discussion to the scope of consciousness science, and conclude that theories of consciousness should be tested and evaluated on humans, and not on systems considerably different from us. Rather than restricting the methodology of consciousness science, we should, at this point, restrict the range of systems upon which it is supposed to be built.",,10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1306023,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e8dcd1a01b0f7bf697c6185bd4f79b59f48fdb2c,,,,,,,,,"45707,83006","45707,83006",GuiSales404,,Rejected,
,Falsification and consciousness,Johannes Kleiner and Erik P. Hoel,Neuroscience of Consciousness,2020,Connected Papers,null,2021,"Abstract The search for a scientific theory of consciousness should result in theories that are falsifiable. However, here we show that falsification is especially problematic for theories of consciousness. We formally describe the standard experimental setup for testing these theories. Based on a theory’s application to some physical system, such as the brain, testing requires comparing a theory’s predicted experience (given some internal observables of the system like brain imaging data) with an inferred experience (using report or behavior). If there is a mismatch between inference and prediction, a theory is falsified. We show that if inference and prediction are independent, it follows that any minimally informative theory of consciousness is automatically falsified. This is deeply problematic since the field’s reliance on report or behavior to infer conscious experiences implies such independence, so this fragility affects many contemporary theories of consciousness. Furthermore, we show that if inference and prediction are strictly dependent, it follows that a theory is unfalsifiable. This affects theories which claim consciousness to be determined by report or behavior. Finally, we explore possible ways out of this dilemma.",,10.1093/nc/niab001,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/697586e9404b69bebbad312836ba200fde79d21d,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,
,Predictive processing as a systematic basis for identifying the neural correlates of consciousness,J. Hohwy and A. Seth,Philosophy and the Mind Sciences,2020,Connected Papers,null,null,"The search for the neural correlates of consciousness is in need of a systematic, principled foundation that can endow putative neural correlates with greater predictive and explanatory value. Here, we propose the predictive processing framework for brain function as a promising candidate for providing this systematic foundation. The proposal is motivated by that framework’s ability to address three general challenges to identifying the neural correlates of consciousness, and to satisfy two constraints common to many theories of consciousness. Implementing the search for neural correlates of consciousness through the lens of predictive processing delivers strong potential for predictive and explanatory value through detailed, systematic mappings between neural substrates and phenomenological structure. We conclude that the predictive processing framework, precisely because it at the outset is not itself a theory of consciousness, has significant potential for advancing the neuroscience of consciousness.",,10.31234/osf.io/nd82g,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5ba5d0b9f511c1d763bafe8a9d4c74fd8e2dbca8,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

PRISMA-based literature reviews require meticulous scrutiny of extensive textual data by multiple reviewers, which is associated with considerable human effort.
Objective
To evaluate feasibility and reliability of using GPT-4 API as a complementary reviewer in systematic literature reviews based on the PRISMA framework.
Methodology
A systematic literature review on the role of natural language processing and Large Language Models (LLMs) in automatic patient-trial matching was conducted using human reviewers and an AI-based reviewer (GPT-4 API). A RAG methodology with LangChain integration was used to process full-text articles. Agreement levels between two human reviewers and GPT-4 API for abstract screening and between a single reviewer and GPT-4 API for full-text parameter extraction were evaluated.
Results
An almost perfect GPT–human reviewer agreement in the abstract screening process (Cohen’s kappa > 0.9) and a lower agreement in the full-text parameter extraction were observed.
Conclusion
As GPT-4 has performed on a par with human reviewers in abstract screening, we conclude that GPT-4 has an exciting potential of being used as a main screening tool for systematic literature reviews, replacing at least one of the human reviewers.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2024.105531,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386505624001941,,,"Systematic literature review, PRISMA, GPT-4 API, AI-based reviewer",,1386-5056,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

Specifically, the proposed fusion framework is separated into two stages: the first image fusion stage and the second color transformation stage. The first stage is a two-stream feature interactional network via common and inherent features extraction modules, which obtains the suboptimal gray fused image retaining rich textural details and highlighting the thermal targets. After generating the suboptimal results, the second color transformation stage is implemented to transfer the color cues from the visible modal to the fused result, which ensures the fused results are consistent to natural visible light image in color appearance and keep a steady brightness and high fidelity.

,Aspect-level recommendation fused with review and rating representations,Heng-Ru Zhang and Ling Lin and Fan Min,Data & Knowledge Engineering,2025,Science@Direct,102417,,"Review contains user opinions about different aspects of an item, which is essential data for aspect-level recommendation. Most existing aspect-level recommendation algorithms are concerned with the degree to which user and item aspects match. However, even if an item is extremely popular due to its high quality, it may only partially match the aspects of a user. A tolerant user may like the item, whereas a strict user may dislike it. This implies that these works disregard the personalized behavior patterns of the user. In this paper, we propose a new Aspect-level Recommendation model fused with Review and Rating, namely ARRR, to address the recommendation bias. First, we introduce rating to explore user behavior patterns and item quality. Then, we present a personalized attention mechanism that generates a set of aspect-level user or item representations from reviews. Finally, we obtain comprehensive user or item representations by combining rating- and review-based representations.

The fewest number of copies of each tool type is employed to prevent tool delays, and job and tool shift times between machines are taken into account. The tools are placed in a central tool magazine (CTM), which shares and serves them to many machines to cut down the price of duplicating the tools in each machine. This simultaneous scheduling problem is challenging to solve because it entails determining the fewest tool copies of each tool kind without tool delay, assigning AGVs and tool copies to job-operations (jb-ons), ordering jb-ons on machines, and related trip operations such as deadheading and loaded flight times for both TT and AGVs. This paper uses a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) framework to present the problem, and a flower pollination algorithm (FPA) is employed to solve it. For verification, a manufacturing company’s industrial problem is employed. The results show that employing two copies each for two tool types and one copy each for the remaining tool types causes no tool delay, reduction in makespan and cost, and the FPA outperforms the Jaya algorithm.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2022.105275,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197622003311,,,"Scheduling, FMS, Flower pollination algorithm, Makespan, Tool transporter, No tool delay",,0952-1976,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

",180,"We here analyse the question of developing artificial consciousness from an evolutionary perspective, taking the evolution of the human brain and its relation with consciousness as a reference model or as a benchmark. This kind of analysis reveals several structural and functional features of the human brain that appear to be key for reaching human-like complex conscious experience and that current research on Artificial Intelligence (AI) should take into account in its attempt to develop systems capable of human-like conscious processing. We argue that, even if AI is limited in its ability to emulate human consciousness for both intrinsic (i.e., structural and architectural) and extrinsic (i.e., related to the current stage of scientific and technological knowledge) reasons, taking inspiration from those characteristics of the brain that make human-like conscious processing possible and/or modulate it, is a potentially promising strategy towards developing conscious AI. Also, it cannot be theoretically excluded that AI research can develop partial or potentially alternative forms of consciousness that are qualitatively different from the human form, and that may be either more or less sophisticated depending on the perspectives. Therefore, we recommend neuroscience-inspired caution in talking about artificial consciousness: since the use of the same word ""consciousness"" for humans and AI becomes ambiguous and potentially misleading, we propose to clearly specify which level and/or type of consciousness AI research aims to develop, as well as what would be common versus differ in AI conscious processing compared to human conscious experience.",,10.48550/arXiv.2405.04540,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c8ae365c40f617f5a20c6a3867a30fa714ec053f,,,,,,,,,"45707,83006","45707,83006",GuiSales404,,Accepted,

This paper studies consciousness from the perspective of theoretical computer science. It formalizes the Global Workspace Theory (GWT) originated by the cognitive neuroscientist Bernard Baars and further developed by him, Stanislas Dehaene, and others. Our major contribution lies in the precise formal definition of a Conscious Turing Machine (CTM), also called a Conscious AI. We define the CTM in the spirit of Alan Turing’s simple yet powerful definition of a computer, the Turing Machine (TM). We are not looking for a complex model of the brain nor of cognition but for a simple model of (the admittedly complex concept of) consciousness. After formally defining CTM, we give a formal definition of consciousness in CTM. We later suggest why the CTM has the feeling of consciousness. The reasonableness of the definitions and explanations can be judged by how well they agree with commonly accepted intuitive concepts of human consciousness, the range of related concepts that the model explains easily and naturally, and the extent of its agreement with scientific evidence.",,10.1142/s2705078521500028,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a336551c6e3a6c19bbe19be3973e66159f2dab9a,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Accepted,

At the same time, it is quite possible that these obstacles will be overcome in the next decade or so.

,Brainish: Formalizing A Multimodal Language for Intelligence and Consciousness,P. Liang,ArXiv,2022,Connected Papers,null,abs/2205.00001,"Having a rich multimodal inner language is an important component of human intelligence that enables several necessary core cognitive functions such as multimodal prediction, translation, and generation. Building upon the Conscious Turing Machine (CTM), a machine model for consciousness proposed by Blum and Blum (2021), we describe the desiderata of a multimodal language called Brainish, comprising words, images, audio, and sensations combined in representations that the CTM's processors use to communicate with each other. We define the syntax and semantics of Brainish before operationalizing this language through the lens of multimodal artificial intelligence, a vibrant research area studying the computational tools necessary for processing and relating information from heterogeneous signals. Our general framework for learning Brainish involves designing (1) unimodal encoders to segment and represent unimodal data, (2) a coordinated representation space that relates and composes unimodal features to derive holistic meaning across multimodal inputs, and (3) decoders to map multimodal representations into predictions (for fusion) or raw data (for translation or generation). Through discussing how Brainish is crucial for communication and coordination in order to achieve consciousness in the CTM, and by implementing a simple version of Brainish and evaluating its capability of demonstrating intelligence on multimodal prediction and retrieval tasks on several real-world image, text, and audio datasets, we argue that such an inner language will be important for advances in machine models of intelligence and consciousness.",,10.48550/arXiv.2205.00001,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/ad45e482fc12f20ae8e4611c46964408361f73e8,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Accepted,

Block,Behavioral and Brain Sciences,1995,Connected Papers,227 - 247,18,"Abstract Consciousness is a mongrel concept: there are a number of very different “consciousnesses.” Phenomenal consciousness is experience; the phenomenally conscious aspect of a state is what it is like to be in that state. The mark of access-consciousness, by contrast, is availability for use in reasoning and rationally guiding speech and action. These concepts are often partly or totally conflated, with bad results. This target article uses as an example a form of reasoning about a function of “consciousness” based on the phenomenon of blindsight. Some information about stimuli in the blind field is represented in the brains of blindsight patients, as shown by their correct “guesses.” They cannot harness this information in the service of action, however, and this is said to show that a function of phenomenal consciousness is somehow to enable information represented in the brain to guide action. But stimuli in the blind field are both access-unconscious and phenomenally unconscious.

,(Dis)confirming theories of consciousness and their predictions: towards a Lakatosian consciousness science,Niccolò Negro,Neuroscience of Consciousness,2024,Connected Papers,null,2024,"Abstract The neuroscience of consciousness is undergoing a significant empirical acceleration thanks to several adversarial collaborations that intend to test different predictions of rival theories of consciousness. In this context, it is important to pair consciousness science with confirmation theory, the philosophical discipline that explores the interaction between evidence and hypotheses, in order to understand how exactly, and to what extent, specific experiments are challenging or validating theories of consciousness. In this paper, I examine this intricate relationship by adopting a Lakatosian lens. I propose that Lakatos’ philosophy of science can aid consciousness scientists to better interpret adversarial collaborations in consciousness science and, more generally, to develop a confirmation-theoretic model of theory-appraisal in this field. I do so by suggesting that such a model be built upon three Lakatos-inspired criteria for assessing the relationship between empirical evidence and theoretical predictions: (i) the model should represent the ‘distinction between prediction and accommodation’; (ii) the model should represent the ‘structural relevance’ of predictions; (iii) the model should represent the ‘boldness’ of the predictions. I argue that a Lakatosian model of theory-appraisal has both normative and descriptive virtues, and can move the debate forward by acknowledging that theory-appraisal needs to consider the diachronic development of theories, their logical structure, and their relationship with background beliefs and knowledge.",,10.1093/nc/niae012,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bdefa3a21b2b9cab1992451d127f00569b43573f,,,,,,,,,"45707,83006","45707,83006",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

,Effects of Awareness on the Control of Attention,Taylor W. Webb and Hope H. Kean and M. Graziano,Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience,2016,Connected Papers,842-851,28,"Abstract Previous studies show that it is possible to attend to a stimulus without awareness of it. Whether attention and awareness are independent or have a specific relationship, however, remains debated. Here, we tested three aspects of visual attention with and without awareness of the visual stimulus. Metacontrast masking rendered participants either subjectively aware or not aware of the stimulus. Attention drawn to the stimulus was measured by using the stimulus as a cue in a spatial attention task. We found that attention was drawn to the stimulus regardless of whether or not people were aware of it. However, attention changed significantly in the absence of awareness in at least three ways. First, attention to a task-relevant stimulus was less stable over time. Second, inhibition of return, the automatic suppression of attention to a task-irrelevant stimulus, was reduced. Third, attention was more driven by the luminance contrast of the stimulus. These findings add to the growing information on the behavior of attention with and without awareness. The findings are also consistent with our recently proposed account of the relationship between attention and awareness. In the attention schema theory, awareness is the internal model of attention. Just as the brain contains a body schema that models the body and helps control the body, so it contains an attention schema that helps control attention. In that theory, in the absence of awareness, the control of attention should suffer in basic ways predictable from dynamical systems theory. The present results confirm some of those predictions.",,10.1162/jocn_a_00931,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5969a22e49faf2b4978e2e602636d1609771d482,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

,A Human-AI Loop Approach for Joint Keyword Discovery and Expectation Estimation in Micropost Event Detection,Akansha Bhardwaj and Jie Yang and Philippe Cudré-Mauroux,ArXiv,2019,Connected Papers,null,abs/1912.00667,"Microblogging platforms such as Twitter are increasingly being used in event detection. Existing approaches mainly use machine learning models and rely on event-related keywords to collect the data for model training. These approaches make strong assumptions on the distribution of the relevant microposts containing the keyword – referred to as the expectation of the distribution – and use it as a posterior regularization parameter during model training. Such approaches are, however, limited as they fail to reliably estimate the informativeness of a keyword and its expectation for model training. This paper introduces a Human-AI loop approach to jointly discover informative keywords for model training while estimating their expectation. Our approach iteratively leverages the crowd to estimate both keyword-specific expectation and the disagreement between the crowd and the model in order to discover new keywords that are most beneficial for model training. These keywords and their expectation not only improve the resulting performance but also make the model training process more transparent. We empirically demonstrate the merits of our approach, both in terms of accuracy and interpretability, on multiple real-world datasets and show that our approach improves the state of the art by 24.3%.",,10.1609/AAAI.V34I03.5626,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b19380b7340a0bb6db40a1b711adadabd0e2ea58,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

,The attention schema theory in a neural network agent: Controlling visuospatial attention using a descriptive model of attention,Andrew I. Wilterson and M. Graziano,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021,Connected Papers,null,118,"Significance Attention, the deep processing of select items, is one of the most important cognitive operations in the brain. But how does the brain control its attention? One proposed part of the mechanism is that the brain builds a model, or attention schema, that helps monitor and predict the changing state of attention. Here, we show that an artificial neural network agent can be trained to control visual attention when it is given an attention schema, but its performance is greatly reduced when the schema is not available. We suggest that the brain may have evolved a model of attention because of the profound practical benefit for the control of attention. In the attention schema theory (AST), the brain constructs a model of attention, the attention schema, to aid in the endogenous control of attention. Growing behavioral evidence appears to support the presence of a model of attention. However, a central question remains: does a controller of attention actually benefit by having access to an attention schema? We constructed an artificial deep Q-learning neural network agent that was trained to control a simple form of visuospatial attention, tracking a stimulus with an attention spotlight in order to solve a catch task. The agent was tested with and without access to an attention schema. In both conditions, the agent received sufficient information such that it should, theoretically, be able to learn the task. We found that with an attention schema present, the agent learned to control its attention spotlight and learned the catch task. Once the agent learned, if the attention schema was then disabled, the agent’s performance was greatly reduced. If the attention schema was removed before learning began, the agent was impaired at learning. The results show how the presence of even a simple attention schema can provide a profound benefit to a controller of attention. We interpret these results as supporting the central argument of AST: the brain contains an attention schema because of its practical benefit in the endogenous control of attention.",,10.1073/pnas.2102421118,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/bc81c911909faee9497ad605b54b560f279018be,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

Further, we show which theories of consciousness are currently considered most promising by respondents and how supposedly different theories cluster together, which dependent measures are considered best to index the presence or absence of consciousness, and which neural measures are thought to be the most likely signatures of consciousness.

,Chapter 11 Higher order dependent type theory,,,1998,Science@Direct,645-715,141,"Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the syntax of dependent predicate logic (DPL). The basis for its syntax is formed by the rules for dependent-type theory (DTT). There are three systems of higher order DTT—higher-order predicate logic over DTT called dependent predicate logic (DPL), polymorphic–dependent-type theory (PDTT), and full higher-order-dependent-type theory (FhoDTT). The PDTT adds both “kind dependency” and “type dependency” to polymorphic simple-type theory (STT). One of the key advantages of DPL over simple predicate logic is that it allows making full use of subset types and quotient types—used in simple predicate logic. The chapter illustrates the special model consisting of partial equivalence relations (PERs) in the effective topos (Eff). It focuses on the (weak) completeness of the fibrations of families of PERs and of ω-sets over Eff.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0049-237X(98)80041-4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049237X98800414,,,,Elsevier,0049-237X,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,
,Linear analysis of genetic algorithms,Lothar M. Schmitt and Chrystopher L. Nehaniv and Robert H. Fujii,Theoretical Computer Science,1998,Science@Direct,101-134,200,"We represent simple and fitness-scaled genetic algorithms by Markov chains on probability distributions over the set of all possible populations of a fixed finite size. Analysis of this formulation yields new insight into the geometric properties of the three phase mutation, crossover, and fitness selection of a genetic algorithm by representing them as stochastic matrices acting on the state space. This indicates new methods using mutation and crossover as the proposal scheme for simulated annealing. We show by explicit estimates that for small mutation rates a genetic algorithm asymptotically spends most of its time in uniform populations regardless of crossover rate. The simple genetic algorithm converges in the following sense: there exists a fully positive limit probability distribution over populations. This distribution is independent of the choice of initial population. We establish strong ergodicity of the underlying inhomogeneous Markov chain for genetic algorithms that use any of a large class of fitness scaling methods including linear fitness scaling, sigma-truncation, and power law scaling. Our analysis even allows for variation in mutation and crossover rates according to a pre-determined schedule, where the mutation rate stays bounded away from zero. We show that the limit probability distribution of such a process is fully positive at all populations of uniform fitness. Consequently, genetic algorithms that use the above fitness scalings do not converge to a population containing only optimal members. This answers a question of G. Rudolph (IEEE Trans. on Neural Networks 5 (1994) 96–101). For a large set of fitness scaling methods, the limit distribution depends on the pre-order induced by the fitness function f, i.e. c ⩾ c′ ↦ f(c) ⩾ f(c′) on possible creatures c and c′, and not on the particular values assumed by the fitness function.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0304-3975(98)00004-8,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397598000048,,,"Stochastic optimization, Fitness-scaled genetic algorithms, fitness-rank dependence, Markov chain model, Spectral analysis of stochastic matrices",,0304-3975,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

Extended observation of phishing organizations has revealed that they have varied skills and talents. This chapter addresses the particular talents of the spammer's approach to phishing.

This chapter provides an introduction to the syntax and semantics of axiomatic logical systems for classical and non–standard logics. The introduction of algebraic semantics is based on avery general, simple, and fruitful idea of introducing the characterizing matrix. Algebraic methods are very well developed and their use is wide spread in the research of different logical systems. The first–order semantics and universal algebra, algebraic semantics for propositional logics, and admissible rules in algebraic logics are also discussed. An axiomatic system for a given propositional logic λ consists of axioms and inference rules. The theorems of logic are formulas that can be derived from the axioms by means of the inference rules. A logical axiomatic system “AS”consists of a collection of inference rules “ASr” and a collection of axioms “ASax”. The properties of logical consequence relation is ├ and every ├ has a matrix semantics. The matrix semantics is easy to obtain, but this semantics is not convenient for dealing with a deeper investigating derivability in axiomatic systems. The admissibility for consequence relations for algebraic logics, their algebraic descriptions, and their general properties are also discussed in this chapter.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0049-237X(97)80003-1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049237X97800031,,,,Elsevier,0049-237X,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

However, it is extremely challenging because the traffic data quality is often affected by the installation position of devices, data collection frequency, interference during the transmission process, etc., thus causing the problem of data sparsity or data missing. To address the issue of traffic state estimation under the scenario of data sparsity, we propose a TSE model that combines the computational graph with physics-informed deep learning (PIDL) methods. Firstly, we apply the computational graph method to determine the parameters of the traffic fundamental diagram. These parameters are embedded into the computational graph framework, and their values are determined through the forward propagation of variables and the backward propagation of errors. Next, we employ the PIDL method to realize TSE (taking the LWR model based on the Greenshields fundamental diagram as an example). The PIDL leverages the advantages of data-driven and model-driven approaches to achieve accurate traffic state estimation. Case studies are conducted using the NGSIM dataset under two sparse data scenarios: loop detectors and probe vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that PIDL can accurately reconstruct the traffic state of the entire road segment based on partially observed data. Furthermore, compared to pure deep learning methods and other baseline models, PIDL performs better in situations with sparse data, thereby proving the feasibility of integrating domain knowledge with deep learning frameworks. This paper fully acknowledges the issue of data sparsity in TSE and effectively addresses it by applying the PIDL method to achieve precise TSE, which holds significant implications for the control and management of real traffic flow.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inffus.2023.101971,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253523002877,,,"Traffic state estimation, Physics-informed deep learning, Computational graph, Data sparsity, LWR model, Fundamental diagram",,1566-2535,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

Every prime implicant of such a function involves at most one complemented and at most one uncomplemented variable, and based on this we give a one-to-one correspondence between submodular functions and partial preorders (reflexive and transitive binary relations), and in particular between the nondegenerate acyclic submodular functions and the partially ordered sets. There is a one-to-one correspondence between the roots of a submodular function and the ideals of the associated partial preorder. There is also a one-to-one correspondence between the prime implicants of the dual of the submodular function and the maximal antichains of the associated partial preorder. Based on these results, we give graph-theoretic characterizations for all minimum prime DNF representations of a submodular function.

,Production strategies for a stochastic lot-sizing problem with constant capacity,N.P. Dellaert and M.T. Melo,European Journal of Operational Research,1996,Science@Direct,281-301,92,"This paper presents a single item capacitated stochastic lot-sizing problem motibated by a Dutch company operating in a Make-To-Order environment. Due to a highly fluctuating and unpredictable demand, it is not possible to keep any finished goods inventory. In response to a customer's order, a fixed delivery date is quoted by the company. The objective is to determine in each period of the planning horizon the optimal size of production lots so that delivery dates are met as closely as possible at the expense of minimal average costs. These include set-up costs, holding costs for orders that are finished before their promised delivery date and penalty costs for orders that are not satisfied on time and are therefore backordered. Given that the optimal production policy is likely to be too complex in this situation, attention is focused on the development of heuristic procedures. In this paper two heuristics are proposed. The first one is an extension of a simple production strategy derived by Dellaert [5] for the uncapacitated version of the problem. The second heuristic is based on the well-known Silver-Meal algorithm for the case of deterministic time-varying demand. Experimental results suggest that the first heuristic gives low average costs especially when the demand variability is low and there are large differences in the cost parameters. The Silver-Meal approach is usually outperformed by the first heuristic in situations where the available production capacity is tight and the demand variability is low.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/0377-2217(95)00166-2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377221795001662,,,"Production planning, Lot-sizing, Heuristics, Markov decision process",,0377-2217,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

In this paper, it is shown that rigid E-unification is NP-complete and that finite complete sets of rigid E-unifiers always exist.

,The automated understanding of simple bar charts,Stephanie Elzer and Sandra Carberry and Ingrid Zukerman,Artificial Intelligence,2011,Science@Direct,526-555,175,"While identifying the intention of an utterance has played a major role in natural language understanding, this work is the first to extend intention recognition to the domain of information graphics. A tenet of this work is the belief that information graphics are a form of language. This is supported by the observation that the overwhelming majority of information graphics from popular media sources appear to have some underlying goal or intended message. As Clark noted, language is more than just words. It is any “signal” (or lack of signal when one is expected), where a signal is a deliberate action that is intended to convey a message (Clark, 1996 [15]). As a form of language, information graphics contain communicative signals that can be used in a computational system to identify the message that the graphic conveys. We identify the communicative signals that appear in simple bar charts, and present an implemented Bayesian network methodology for reasoning about these signals and hypothesizing a bar chart's intended message. Once the message conveyed by an information graphic has been inferred, it can then be used to facilitate access to this information resource for a variety of users, including 1) users of digital libraries, 2) visually impaired users, and 3) users of devices where graphics are impractical or inaccessible.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2010.10.003,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370210001670,,,"Natural language processing, Bayesian networks, Bar charts, Communicative signals",,0004-3702,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

We are excited to welcome the CSCW community back to Portland, Oregon, where the second CSCW conference was held in 1988. Both Portland and CSCW have matured a great deal during the intervening 29 years. We hope that you will find that Portland provides a stimulating environment for our conference.CSCW is the premier venue for presenting research in the design and use of technologies that affect groups, organizations, communities, and networks. Bringing together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry, CSCW explores the technical, social, material, and theoretical challenges of designing technology to support collaborative work and life activities. CSCW welcomes a diverse range of topics and research methodologies. Studies often involve the development and application of novel technologies and/or ethnographic studies that inform design practice or theory. The mission of the conference is to share research that advances the state of human knowledge and improves both the design of systems and the ways they are used. The diversity of work in our conference program reflects the diversity of technology use in people's work, social, and civic lives as well as the geographic and cultural diversity of contributors.As many of you know, CSCW follows a rigorous ""revise and resubmit"" review process that uses peer review to improve submitted papers while maintaining a high-quality threshold for final acceptance. We also help prepare the next generation of reviewers with a mentorship program in which students review papers under the guidance of an experienced reviewer. This year we have the largest CSCW program ever. We had 530 submitted papers and 183 were accepted for presentation at the conference. The program also includes 4 papers published in ACM Transactions on Human- Computer Interaction (TOCHI). In addition, we will feature 14 workshops, 56 posters, 12 demos, and 3 panels.Lili Cheng of Microsoft Research will open the conference, speaking on ""Conversational AI \&amp; Lessons Learned."" Our closing plenary will feature Jorge Cham, the creator of PhD Comics, who will talk about, ""The Science Gap.""

,"Consciousness: here, there and everywhere?",G. Tononi and C. Koch,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences,2015,Connected Papers,null,370,"The science of consciousness has made great strides by focusing on the behavioural and neuronal correlates of experience. However, while such correlates are important for progress to occur, they are not enough if we are to understand even basic facts, for example, why the cerebral cortex gives rise to consciousness but the cerebellum does not, though it has even more neurons and appears to be just as complicated. Moreover, correlates are of little help in many instances where we would like to know if consciousness is present: patients with a few remaining islands of functioning cortex, preterm infants, non-mammalian species and machines that are rapidly outperforming people at driving, recognizing faces and objects, and answering difficult questions. To address these issues, we need not only more data but also a theory of consciousness—one that says what experience is and what type of physical systems can have it. Integrated information theory (IIT) does so by starting from experience itself via five phenomenological axioms: intrinsic existence, composition, information, integration and exclusion. From these it derives five postulates about the properties required of physical mechanisms to support consciousness. The theory provides a principled account of both the quantity and the quality of an individual experience (a quale), and a calculus to evaluate whether or not a particular physical system is conscious and of what. Moreover, IIT can explain a range of clinical and laboratory findings, makes a number of testable predictions and extrapolates to a number of problematic conditions. The theory holds that consciousness is a fundamental property possessed by physical systems having specific causal properties. It predicts that consciousness is graded, is common among biological organisms and can occur in some very simple systems. Conversely, it predicts that feed-forward networks, even complex ones, are not conscious, nor are aggregates such as groups of individuals or heaps of sand. Also, in sharp contrast to widespread functionalist beliefs, IIT implies that digital computers, even if their behaviour were to be functionally equivalent to ours, and even if they were to run faithful simulations of the human brain, would experience next to nothing.",,10.1098/rstb.2014.0167,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/1eb314a1b96d7efa15241de6cb396dde51e09fe5,,,,,,,,Abordagem exclusivamente fisiológica sobre consciência,"45707,83012","45707,88339",GuiSales404,GuiSales404,Rejected,

,The Constrained Disorder Principle May Account for Consciousness,Tal Sigawi and Omer Hamtzany and Josef Daniel Shakargy and Yaron Ilan,Brain Sciences,2024,Connected Papers,null,14,"There is still controversy surrounding the definition and mechanisms of consciousness. The constrained disorder principle (CDP) defines complex systems by their dynamic borders, limiting their inherent disorder. In line with the CDP, the brain exhibits a disorder bounded by dynamic borders essential for proper function, efficient energy use, and life support under continuous perturbations. The brain’s inherent variability contributes to its adaptability and flexibility. Neuronal signal variability challenges the association of brain structures with consciousness and methods for assessing consciousness. The present paper discusses some theories about consciousness, emphasizing their failure to explain the brain’s variability. This paper describes how the CDP accounts for consciousness’s variability, complexity, entropy, and uncertainty. Using newly developed second-generation artificial intelligence systems, we describe how CDP-based platforms may improve disorders of consciousness (DoC) by accounting for consciousness variability, complexity, entropy, and uncertainty. This platform could be used to improve response to current interventions and develop new therapeutic regimens for patients with DoC in future studies.",,10.3390/brainsci14030209,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/366fa2574a244e160f66c14c647e4f368857db8e,,,,,,,,,"45707,83006","45707,83006",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

In this work, we propose and then empirically assess an embodied agent with a structure based on global workspace theory (GWT) as specified in the recently proposed “indicator properties” of consciousness. In contrast to prior works on GWT which utilized single modalities, our agent is trained to navigate 3D environments based on realistic audiovisual inputs. We find that the global workspace architecture performs better and more robustly at smaller working memory sizes, as compared to a standard recurrent architecture.

Graziano,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021,Connected Papers,null,118,"Significance We all intuitively know what it is to be subjectively aware of something. For decades, psychologists have also studied the brain’s mechanisms of directing attention. But awareness and attention are not the same and can be separated. How do they relate? Here, we show that a part of the brain, the right temporoparietal junction, may be involved in a specific relationship in which awareness of an item permits the control of attention on that item. The attention schema theory posits a specific relationship between subjective awareness and attention, in which awareness is the control model that the brain uses to aid in the endogenous control of attention. In previous experiments, we developed a behavioral paradigm in human subjects to manipulate awareness and attention. The paradigm involved a visual cue that could be used to guide attention to a target stimulus. In task 1, subjects were aware of the cue, but not aware that it provided information about the target. The cue measurably drew exogenous attention to itself. In addition, implicitly, the subjects’ endogenous attention mechanism used the cue to help shift attention to the target. In task 2, subjects were no longer aware of the cue. The cue still measurably drew exogenous attention to itself, yet without awareness of the cue, the subjects’ endogenous control mechanism was no longer able to use the cue to control attention. Thus, the control of attention depended on awareness. Here, we tested the two tasks while scanning brain activity in human volunteers. We predicted that the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) would be active in relation to the process in which awareness helps control attention. This prediction was confirmed. The right TPJ was active in relation to the effect of the cue on attention in task 1; it was not measurably active in task 2. The difference was significant. In our interpretation, the right TPJ is involved in an interaction in which awareness permits the control of attention.",,10.1073/pnas.2026099118,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/3470543d0e365278872f865bc11526b203906c4d,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

,A Runtime Framework of the Mind,Fangfang Li and Xiaojie Zhang,,2022,Connected Papers,,,"How the mind works is the ultimate mystery for human beings. This paper proposed a framework to solve it. We call it the self-programming system. The self-programming system can learn, store and apply the functions of bodies, external tools, and even the mind itself uniformly. However, due to the generality of the mind, traditional scientific methods are not suitable for validating a theory of mind. Therefore, we appeal to show the explanatory power of the self-programming system. Due to this reason, we applied this framework to solve the problem of consciousness. By comparing our solution to the popular theories of consciousness, we found that these theories only captured different aspects of our solution to consciousness. Beyond this, our solution also solved the hard problem of consciousness by showing that the existence of objectively unexplainable qualia is a matter of course even in a purely physical world. Our theory of consciousness manifests a new comprehensive perspective to understand what reality and knowledge are. And our framework provides a new approach to building human-level artificial intelligence.",,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/729b625376441b817cf212df7137336a65be6a6c,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

Today, the main search for an answer to these questions is centered around the problem of the neural foundations of consciousness. In this work, I will review the critical characteristics of consciousness and will formulate the requirements that a fundamental scientific theory of consciousness must meet. With the help of these criteria, I will analyze the most influential neuroscience theories of consciousness. It will be shown that they satisfy some of the key requirements, but there is none that would meet all of them. I will suggest that to understand consciousness, we need to consider the brain not as a connectome – neural network, but as a cognitome – a neural hypernetwork consisting of neuronal groups with specific cognitive properties. The structure of the cognitome is the structure of the mind, and consciousness is a specific process of large-scale integration of cognitive elements in this neural hypernetwork.",,10.31857/S0044467721010032,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/28690cec748373280c24952c178f8cbd6686e655,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

,A blueprint for conscious machines,Arlindo L. Oliveira,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2022,Connected Papers,null,119,"Although it has been the subject of human thought for many centuries, consciousness remains a mysterious and controversial topic. Every one of us is overly familiar with the phenomenon, but there is little agreement on what it is, what it entails, and how it is created. Certainly, no other phenomenon is simultaneously so familiar and so hard to explain. Researchers from fields as different as medicine, philosophy, psychology, neurobiology, and computer science have tried for centuries to frame, describe, and address the mind–body problem—how consciousness arises from purely physical processes—but success has been, to say the least, limited. Many believe that it is a phenomenon that will remain, forever, unknowable, outside the reach of human understanding. David Chalmers (1) famously argued that, while we may advance in our understanding of the different physical processes that are associated with consciousness (the easy problems), we will never be able to understand the process that leads to subjective experiences (the hard problem), since understanding this phenomenon represents a challenge of an entirely different nature. Other theories, such as mysterianism, defend that, while the phenomenon may be understandable in principle, it will never be accessible to the human mind (2), due to intrinsic limitations of the human brain. Despite these difficulties, many scientists and philosophers have advanced tentative explanations for the phenomenon (3–5), and proposed ways to assess it (6), measure it (7), create it in machines (8), and even use it to improve the performance of artificial intelligence systems (9). The paper by Blum and Blum (10), in PNAS, approaches the problem from an engineering perspective, by showing how a specific computational architecture, which they have proposed (11), can explain several phenomena that are closely related to consciousness.",,10.1073/pnas.2205971119,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fcad037a73ef85653153cb8c6d683145c4d60391,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Accepted,

,Topic modeling algorithms and applications: A survey,Aly Abdelrazek and Yomna Eid and Eman Gawish and Walaa Medhat and Ahmed Hassan,Information Systems,2023,Science@Direct,102131,112,"Topic modeling is used in information retrieval to infer the hidden themes in a collection of documents and thus provides an automatic means to organize, understand and summarize large collections of textual information. Topic models also offer an interpretable representation of documents used in several downstream Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Modeling techniques vary from probabilistic graphical models to the more recent neural models. This paper surveys topic models from four aspects. The first aspect categorizes different topic modeling techniques into four categories: algebraic, fuzzy, probabilistic, and neural. We review the wide variety of available models from each category, highlight differences and similarities between models and model categories using a unified perspective, investigate these models’ characteristics and limitations, and discuss their proper use cases. The second aspect illustrates six criteria for proper evaluation of topic models, from modeling quality to interpretability, stability, efficiency, and beyond. Topic modeling has found applications in various disciplines, owing to its interpretability. We examine these applications along with some popular software tools which provide an implementation of some models. The fourth aspect reviews available datasets and benchmarks. Using two benchmark datasets, we conducted experiments to compare seven topic models along the proposed metrics. The discussion highlights the differences between the models and their relative suitability for various applications. It notes the relationship between evaluation metrics and proposes four key aspects to help decide which model to use for an application. Our discussion also shows that the research trends move towards developing and tuning neural topic models and leveraging the power of pre-trained language models.

One main solution to few-shot image classification is deep metric learning. These methods, by classifying unseen samples according to their distances to few seen samples in an embedding space learned by powerful deep neural networks, can avoid overfitting to few training images in few-shot image classification and have achieved the state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we provide an up-to-date review of deep metric learning methods for few-shot image classification from 2018 to 2022 and categorize them into three groups according to three stages of metric learning, namely learning feature embeddings, learning class representations, and learning distance measures. Under this taxonomy, we identify the trends of transitioning from learning task-agnostic features to task-specific features, from simple computation of prototypes to computing task-dependent prototypes or learning prototypes, from using analytical distance or similarity measures to learning similarities through convolutional or graph neural networks.

,Embedding enhancement with foreground feature alignment and primitive knowledge for few-shot learning,Xiaoqi Zheng and Jia Lu,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,2024,Science@Direct,108823,135,"Few-Shot Learning (FSL) targets a model to quickly discriminate new categories with limited samples. While most methods struggle to effectively utilize the knowledge learned in the base classes, resulting in models that fail to alleviate the domain gap between training and evaluation. Conversely, humans often enable rapid discrimination by two ways: reinforcing impressions through comparing unknown categories with related objects in memory; Searching for the maximum shared information within the intra-class. Motivated by this, in this paper, we propose a novel Transformer-based Embedding Enhancement Network (TEEN) that adaptively leverages the knowledge learned from the base classes, which we refer to as ‘primitive knowledge’, to complete and distinguish the embeddings for novel classes. Additionally, to reduce interference from background features, we introduce the Transformer-based Foreground Feature Alignment (TFFA) to enhance the representation of image foreground. Ultimately, TEEN enhances the embeddings through foreground alignment and primitive knowledge completion, achieving improved performance in few-shot classification. Extensive experiments on inductive few-shot tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art results in cross-domain few-shot tasks.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108823,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197624009813,,,"Few-shot learning, Metric leaning, Primitive knowledge, Feature alignment, Cross-domain",,0952-1976,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

We also propose an approach to uncover the order of such embedded topics. To determine the number of topics, the proposed method relies on the analysis of eigenvalues of a conditional probability matrix derived from the document-term matrix.

We design several novel models and mechanisms to forecast the behavioral parameters of road vehicles in this architecture, combining a developed artificial neural network method and a statistical technique. Considering the lack of large-scale deployment of C-ITS at present, a new simulator (SoC-ITSS v2.1) is independently designed with two main aims. The first is to establish a massive dataset that is unavailable for current transportation systems, but necessary for back propagation neural network-based forecasting and statistics models. Our second aim is to provide an effective visual verification environment for this proposed mechanism. Using our newly developed simulator, these proposed models and methods are verified under two typical authorization policies (First-Arrival-First-Pass-Multi-Queue for ordinary C-ITS and Highest-Weight-First-Pass-Multi-Queue for SoC-ITS).

ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event. With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are excited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 received over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In addition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 workshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've prepared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main conference occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be accessible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conference period.This year's conference features three distinguished academic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea (BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in the Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants.

Sparse labels from a human annotator are iteratively propagated to generate a full segmentation of the network by fine-tuning a pre-trained model of an allied task via a few-shot learning paradigm. We show that the proposed framework significantly reduces the amount of human interaction needed in annotating point clouds, without sacrificing on the quality of the annotations. Our experiments also suggest the suitability of the framework in annotating large datasets by noting a reduction in human interaction as the number of full annotations completed by the system increases.

Wilterson,Cognitive Neuropsychology,2020,Connected Papers,155 - 172,37,"ABSTRACT Here we examine how people’s understanding of consciousness may have been shaped by an implicit theory of mind. This social cognition approach may help to make sense of an apparent divide between the physically incoherent consciousness we think we have and the complex, rich, but mechanistic consciousness we may actually have. We suggest this approach helps reconcile some of the current cognitive neuroscience theories of consciousness. We argue that a single, coherent explanation of consciousness is available and has been for some time, encompassing the views of many researchers, but is not yet recognized. It is obscured partly by terminological differences, and partly because researchers view isolated pieces of it as rival theories.

,A Relativistic Theory of Consciousness,Nir Lahav and Zachariah A. Neemeh,Frontiers in Psychology,2022,Connected Papers,null,12,"In recent decades, the scientific study of consciousness has significantly increased our understanding of this elusive phenomenon. Yet, despite critical development in our understanding of the functional side of consciousness, we still lack a fundamental theory regarding its phenomenal aspect. There is an “explanatory gap” between our scientific knowledge of functional consciousness and its “subjective,” phenomenal aspects, referred to as the “hard problem” of consciousness. The phenomenal aspect of consciousness is the first-person answer to “what it’s like” question, and it has thus far proved recalcitrant to direct scientific investigation. Naturalistic dualists argue that it is composed of a primitive, private, non-reductive element of reality that is independent from the functional and physical aspects of consciousness. Illusionists, on the other hand, argue that it is merely a cognitive illusion, and that all that exists are ultimately physical, non-phenomenal properties. We contend that both the dualist and illusionist positions are flawed because they tacitly assume consciousness to be an absolute property that doesn’t depend on the observer. We develop a conceptual and a mathematical argument for a relativistic theory of consciousness in which a system either has or doesn’t have phenomenal consciousness with respect to some observer. Phenomenal consciousness is neither private nor delusional, just relativistic. In the frame of reference of the cognitive system, it will be observable (first-person perspective) and in other frame of reference it will not (third-person perspective). These two cognitive frames of reference are both correct, just as in the case of an observer that claims to be at rest while another will claim that the observer has constant velocity. Given that consciousness is a relativistic phenomenon, neither observer position can be privileged, as they both describe the same underlying reality. Based on relativistic phenomena in physics we developed a mathematical formalization for consciousness which bridges the explanatory gap and dissolves the hard problem. Given that the first-person cognitive frame of reference also offers legitimate observations on consciousness, we conclude by arguing that philosophers can usefully contribute to the science of consciousness by collaborating with neuroscientists to explore the neural basis of phenomenal structures.",,10.3389/fpsyg.2021.704270,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6eea6b60ad38ac193c43e547f0bf163a40b26441,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

There is a growing interest in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to enhance various aspects of clinical trials. The goal of this systematic review is to assess the impact of implementing AI approaches on different aspects of oncology clinical trials.
Methods
Pertinent keywords were used to find relevant articles published in PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases, which described the clinical application of AI approaches. A quality evaluation utilizing a customized checklist specifically adapted was conducted. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42024537153).
Results
Out of the identified 2833 studies, 72 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. Clinical Trial Enrollment & Eligibility were among the most commonly studied clinical trial aspects with 30 papers. The prediction of outcomes was covered in 25 studies of which 15 addressed the prediction of patients' survival and 10 addressed the prediction of drug outcomes. The trial design was studied in 10 articles. Three studies addressed each of the personalized treatments and decision-making, while one addressed data management. The results demonstrate using AI in cancer clinical trials has the potential to increase clinical trial enrollment, predict clinical outcomes, improve trial design, enhance personalized treatments, and increase concordance in decision-making. Additionally, automating some areas and tasks, clinical trials were made more efficient, and human error was minimized. Nevertheless, concerns and restrictions related to the application of AI in clinical studies are also noted.
Conclusion
AI tools have the potential to revolutionize the design, enrollment rate, and outcome prediction of oncology clinical trials.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artmed.2025.103066,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0933365725000016,,,"Artificial intelligence, Machine learning, Deep learning, Oncology clinical trials",,0933-3657,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

,Deriving consensus in multiagent systems,Eithan Ephrati and Jeffrey S. Rosenschein,Artificial Intelligence,1996,Science@Direct,21-74,87,"Consider the designers of a multiagent environment, who are charged with establishing the rules by which agents in an encounter will interact. Once the rules of encounter have been determined, each builder of each agent is free to design his own machine any way that he wants. However, the rules that were established will certainly affect the choices he makes in building his own agent. In this article we suggest an economic decision process that can be used to derive multiagent consensus, namely, the Clarke tax mechanism (E.H. Clarke, 1971). Consensus is reached through the process of voting; each agent expresses its preferences, and a group choice mechanism is used to select the result. Clarke tax-like mechanisms provide a set of attractive alternatives for the designers of multiagent environments, particularly if those environments consist of individually motivated heterogeneous agents. The Clarke tax mechanism has many desirable properties such as non-manipulability, individual rationality, and maximization of the agents' global utility. However, though theoretically attractive, the Clarke tax presents a number of difficulties when one attempts to use it in practical implementations. This article examines how the Clarke tax could be used as an effective consensus mechanism in domains consisting of automated agents. In particular, we consider how agents can come to a consensus without needing to reveal full information about their preferences, and without needing to generate alternatives prior to the voting process.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/0004-3702(95)00105-0,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0004370295001050,,,,,0004-3702,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

All known axiomatizations of iteration theories consist of the Conway identities and a complicated equation scheme, the commutative identity. The results of this paper show that the commutative identity is implied by the Conway identities and a weak form of the Park induction principle. Hence, we obtain a simple first order axiomatization of the (in)equational theory of iteration.

,Toward a universal theory of consciousness,Ryota Kanai and Ippei Fujisawa,Neuroscience of Consciousness,2024,Connected Papers,null,2024,"Abstract While falsifiability has been broadly discussed as a desirable property of a theory of consciousness, in this paper, we introduce the meta-theoretic concept of “Universality” as an additional desirable property for a theory of consciousness. The concept of universality, often assumed in physics, posits that the fundamental laws of nature are consistent and apply equally everywhere in the universe and remain constant over time. This assumption is crucial in science, acting as a guiding principle for developing and testing theories. When applied to theories of consciousness, universality can be defined as the ability of a theory to determine whether any fully described dynamical system is conscious or non-conscious. Importantly, for a theory to be universal, the determinant of consciousness needs to be defined as an intrinsic property of a system as opposed to replying on the interpretation of the external observer. The importance of universality originates from the consideration that given that consciousness is a natural phenomenon, it could in principle manifest in any physical system that satisfies a certain set of conditions whether it is biological or non-biological. To date, apart from a few exceptions, most existing theories do not possess this property. Instead, they tend to make predictions as to the neural correlates of consciousness based on the interpretations of brain functions, which makes those theories only applicable to brain-centric systems. While current functionalist theories of consciousness tend to be heavily reliant on our interpretations of brain functions, we argue that functionalist theories could be converted to a universal theory by specifying mathematical formulations of the constituent concepts. While neurobiological and functionalist theories retain their utility in practice, we will eventually need a universal theory to fully explain why certain types of systems possess consciousness.",,10.1093/nc/niae022,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c45397c565e1dd54c31340ad8c24516d86f5377d,,,,,,,,,"45707,83006","45707,83006",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

Blum,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2021,Connected Papers,null,119,"Significance This paper provides evidence that a theoretical computer science (TCS) perspective can add to our understanding of consciousness by providing a simple framework for employing tools from computational complexity theory and machine learning. Just as the Turing machine is a simple model to define and explore computation, the Conscious Turing Machine (CTM) is a simple model to define and explore consciousness (and related concepts). The CTM is not a model of the brain or cognition, nor is it intended to be, but a simple substrate-independent computational model of (the admittedly complex concept of) consciousness. This paper is intended to introduce this approach, show its possibilities, and stimulate research in consciousness from a TCS perspective.",,10.1073/pnas.2115934119,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/12c3f818430ffccd1cac64b6e91a750350917d27,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Accepted,

We first demonstrate that the common approach of modeling dependent random variables is usually surprisingly inadequate, and a general “functional approach” is presented as a practical modeling alternative. Adopting this modeling approach, we then present a procedure for deriving the stochastic characteristics of the model's objective variable. In the context of stochastic breakeven analysis, this means determining the probabilities of achieving various profit levels and the expected utility of the stochastic profit. The procedure allows the model's random variables to assume diverse distribution and dependency forms, and the simplicity and reliability of the procedure is demonstrated by a numerical example.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/0377-2217(79)90226-1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0377221779902261,,,,,0377-2217,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

,Illusionism Big and Small: Some Options for Explaining Consciousness,Michael S. A. Graziano,eNeuro,2024,Connected Papers,null,11,"Illusionism is a general philosophical framework in which specific theories of consciousness can be constructed without having to invoke a magical mind essence. The advantages of illusionism are not widely recognized, perhaps because scholars tend to think only of the most extreme forms and miss the range of possibilities. The brain's internal models are never fully accurate, nothing is exactly as the brain represents it, and therefore some element of illusionism is almost certainly necessary for any working theory of consciousness or of any other property that is accessed through introspection. Here I describe the illusionist framework and propose six specific theories. One purpose of this article is to demonstrate the range of possibilities in a domain that is not yet sufficiently explored. The second purpose is to argue that even existing, popular theories, such as the integrated information theory or the global workspace theory, can be transformed and greatly strengthened by adding an illusionist layer. The third purpose is to argue that when illusionist logic is used, even very disparate theories of consciousness that emerge from unrelated conceptual origins begin to converge onto a deeper, unified understanding.",,10.1523/ENEURO.0210-24.2024,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/75887e3efe61fca79ecb75114c8939ba0f9f9d1b,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,
,Chapter 7. Ordinary Partition Relations for Ordinal Numbers,,,1977,Science@Direct,153-183,91,"Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the partition symbol for well ordered types—that is, for ordinal numbers—and provides its definition. The various conventions concerning the use of the partition symbol adopted for cardinal numbers are followed. The problems concerning the symbol for ordinal numbers are considerably more ramified than those for cardinal numbers. The chapter deals with the partitions of [ωα]2 into two classes, mainly for finite α. The chapter also proves the Chang's theorem for ωω. The chapter considers the relations of the form ω1 → (α1,…., ακ) and proves that ω1 → (α)2κ for countable α and finite κ. The chapter clearly distinguishes between the order type of a well-ordered set and its cardinality. A partition relation between cardinal numbers is considered equivalent to the same relation among the corresponding initial ordinals. A lemma serving as the starting point for an inductive construction of an almost homogeneous set is also presented in the chapter.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0049-237X(08)70671-2,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049237X08706712,,,,Elsevier,0049-237X,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,
,Chapter 8 Polymorphic type theory,,,1998,Science@Direct,441-507,141,"Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the syntactic aspects of the polymorphic-type theories (PTTs). The chapter describes how specific calculi can be defined on top of a polymorphic signature—giving atomic types and kinds with function symbols—and establishing their relation to predicate logics, via propositions as types. Types in simple-type theory (STT) are built up from atomic types using type constructors such as → * , 1 or + , 0. In polymorphic-type theory (PTT), one can use type variables α, β, γ to build types. This innovation in PTT gives rise to an extra level of indexing, not only by term variables (as in STT) but also by type variables. There are three versions of polymorphic type theory—first order PTT λ→, second order PTT λ2, and higher order PTT λω. The functional programming language ML is loosely based on the first order polymorphic lambda calculus λ→. There is also a higher-order functional programming language —QUEST. The fibred categories needed to model PTTs are essentially same as for (higher-order) predicate logics, except that the fibers need not be preordered.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/S0049-237X(98)80038-4,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049237X98800384,,,,Elsevier,0049-237X,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

Ganesan,Computers & Structures,1993,Science@Direct,1057-1071,48,Cylindrical shells with discontinuity in the thickness and that are subjected to axisymmetric loading have been analysed. Two types of finite elements are used: the first is based on thin shell theory and the second on thick shell theory. The loadings considered are a uniform internal pressure and a circular ring load at the mid-section. The effect of these loads for various end conditions and various step-ratios in the thickness have been analysed. Numerical results are presented and compared for both the theories. It has been shown that the transverse normal stress acting along the thickness direction is not negligible compared to other stresses at places of discontinuity either in the thickness or in the loading. The weight of the shell is kept constant for various step-ratios.,,https://doi.org/10.1016/0045-7949(93)90440-O,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004579499390440O,,,,,0045-7949,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,
,CHAPTER 10 - APPROXIMATE METHODS OF SOLVING PARTIAL DIFFERENTIAL AND INTEGRAL EQUATIONS,I.S. BEREZIN and N.P. ZHIDKOV,,1965,Science@Direct,432-671,,"Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the approximate methods of solving partial differential and integral equations. Partial differential and integral equations are encountered in many fields of science. Only in the simplest cases, a solution can be found in implicit form or in the form of a finite formula. Approximate methods are, therefore, of particular importance for the solution of partial differential equations, sets of partial differential equations, and integral equations, for the problems of mathematical physics. The first category consists mainly of Fourier's method of solving boundary value problems in partial differential equations where the exact solution is in the form of a certain series and the approximate solution is the sum of the first few terms. The method of characteristics for solving equations and sets of equations of the hyperbolic type is essentially a finite difference method. Moreover, only in this method the partial differential equation or set of such equations is first reduced to an equivalent set of ordinary differential equations, which is then solved by the difference method.",,https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-010011-1.50009-1,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080100111500091,,,,Pergamon,,,,,"45707,82874","45707,82874",GuiSales404,,Rejected,
,The search for invertebrate consciousness,Jonathan C. P. Birch,"Nous (Detroit, Mich.)",2020,Connected Papers,133 - 153,56,"There is no agreement on whether any invertebrates are conscious and no agreement on a methodology that could settle the issue. How can the debate move forward? I distinguish three broad types of approach: theory-heavy, theory-neutral and theory-light. Theory-heavy and theory-neutral approaches face serious problems, motivating a middle path: the theory-light approach. At the core of the theory-light approach is a minimal commitment about the relation between phenomenal consciousness and cognition that is compatible with many specific theories of consciousness: the hypothesis that phenomenally conscious perception of a stimulus facilitates, relative to unconscious perception, a cluster of cognitive abilities in relation to that stimulus. This “facilitation hypothesis” can productively guide inquiry into invertebrate consciousness. What is needed? At this stage, not more theory, and not more undirected data gathering. What is needed is a systematic search for consciousness-linked cognitive abilities, their relationships to each other, and their sensitivity to masking.",,10.1111/nous.12351,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/53566c1b8a6687c9b754e9af8f8b2a1319e8a60c,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,
,A conceptual framework for consciousness,M. Graziano,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2022,Connected Papers,null,119,"This article argues that consciousness has a logically sound, explanatory framework, different from typical accounts that suffer from hidden mysticism. The article has three main parts. The first describes background principles concerning information processing in the brain, from which one can deduce a general, rational framework for explaining consciousness. The second part describes a specific theory that embodies those background principles, the Attention Schema Theory. In the past several years, a growing body of experimental evidence—behavioral evidence, brain imaging evidence, and computational modeling—has addressed aspects of the theory. The final part discusses the evolution of consciousness. By emphasizing the specific role of consciousness in cognition and behavior, the present approach leads to a proposed account of how consciousness may have evolved over millions of years, from fish to humans. The goal of this article is to present a comprehensive, overarching framework in which we can understand scientifically what consciousness is and what key adaptive roles it plays in brain function.",,10.1073/pnas.2116933119,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f2d0f36bfa5eaf4977aa69edea0a432666d57f6c,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,

,The attention schema theory: a mechanistic account of subjective awareness,M. Graziano and Taylor W. Webb,Frontiers in Psychology,2015,Connected Papers,null,6,"We recently proposed the attention schema theory, a novel way to explain the brain basis of subjective awareness in a mechanistic and scientifically testable manner. The theory begins with attention, the process by which signals compete for the brain’s limited computing resources. This internal signal competition is partly under a bottom–up influence and partly under top–down control. We propose that the top–down control of attention is improved when the brain has access to a simplified model of attention itself. The brain therefore constructs a schematic model of the process of attention, the ‘attention schema,’ in much the same way that it constructs a schematic model of the body, the ‘body schema.’ The content of this internal model leads a brain to conclude that it has a subjective experience. One advantage of this theory is that it explains how awareness and attention can sometimes become dissociated; the brain’s internal models are never perfect, and sometimes a model becomes dissociated from the object being modeled. A second advantage of this theory is that it explains how we can be aware of both internal and external events. The brain can apply attention to many types of information including external sensory information and internal information about emotions and cognitive states. If awareness is a model of attention, then this model should pertain to the same domains of information to which attention pertains. A third advantage of this theory is that it provides testable predictions. If awareness is the internal model of attention, used to help control attention, then without awareness, attention should still be possible but should suffer deficits in control. In this article, we review the existing literature on the relationship between attention and awareness, and suggest that at least some of the predictions of the theory are borne out by the evidence.",,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00500,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/750d23a99464489bd9e656faa3ef31ca1cb4119d,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,
,Hard criteria for empirical theories of consciousness,Adrien Doerig and Aaron Schurger and M. Herzog,Cognitive Neuroscience,2020,Connected Papers,41 - 62,12,"ABSTRACT Consciousness is now a well-established field of empirical research. A large body of experimental results has been accumulated and is steadily growing. In parallel, many Theories of Consciousness (ToCs) have been proposed. These theories are diverse in nature, ranging from computational to neurophysiological and quantum theoretical approaches. This contrasts with other fields of natural science, which host a smaller number of competing theories. We suggest that one reason for this abundance of extremely different theories may be the lack of stringent criteria specifying how empirical data constrains ToCs. First, we argue that consciousness is a well-defined topic from an empirical point of view and motivate a purely empirical stance on the quest for consciousness. Second, we present a checklist of criteria that, we propose, empirical ToCs need to cope with. Third, we review 13 of the most influential ToCs and subject them to the criteria. Our analysis helps to situate these different ToCs in the theoretical landscapeand sheds light on their strengths and weaknesses from a strictly empirical point of view.",,10.1080/17588928.2020.1772214,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6a2fd985d926673863670e7a43cb52d63de95773,,,,,,,,,"45707,82998","45707,82998",GuiSales404,,Rejected,
